The Senator and the General
by Raymond
HIs piece is written in the belief
that it represents the point of view
of a very, very large group of Americans. The political platform of this
group is simple. It has just one plank,
which is a call for a change of Presidents and party control in Washington.
These people regard that change as a
supreme necessity. For unless there is
such a change, the principles and the
integrity of this republic will
be fundamentally, perhaps
irreparably, impaired. They
consider this need so great
that the personality of the
person who fulfills it is, while
important, secondary.
A friend of mine, Alfred
A. Knopf, was expressing
the sentiment of this group
when he said: “I have no
sympathy for people who
say that unless a candidate is nominated who precisely meets their

Two Republican candidates now
dominate the scene. In their order of
entry, not necessarily of importance,
they are Senator Taft and General
Eisenhower. Each has thousands of
sincere, eager supporters, hardly one

Administration which he now proposes to supplant. But, they conclude,
he has immense prestige which offers
assurance of election, great administrative ability, familiarity with Euro-

pean affairs, and established integrity.

would, how-

exaggeration of the differences between Taft and
Eisenhower to a point where
it will be impossible to present a common cause after
the Republican convention in July.
These two candidates are far_more
than merely honorable men and patriotic Americans. Each has attained
towering eminence in his field. Both
will have a high place in history.

Beard, a distinguished American historian, said after reading every word

Others wonder how he would succeed

and by failing to be sufficiently intent
upon government economy. But these
Taft supporters conclude that their
