the Hyster 20 because it transports fast,

rolls on pneumatic tires; is rugged and

powerful.
OPERATORS like it because Hyster steers

For Wisconsin enjoys a partial but
proprietary ownership in this means of
guiding the nomination of Presidents.
Like many other reforms
collectively called progressivism, Presidential primaries originated in the early
years of this century. In the

The Presidential primary
was born amid high hopes.
It was designed to strike
:
the shackles off the oppressed citizen
and permit him to take over from the
bosses and political machines. Democracy was to reign in selections as well

despite its approval by President Truman in his letter to
New Hampshire. A major
party behind a single nominee can barely afford to
spread its effort to all states
in a Presidential election.
But a single candidate for
the nomination could not possibly raise
the money or find the time for such
an effort; that is, no candidate except
a President in office such as Truman

as elections.

Roosevelt and President Taft a fine

But after that Presidential primaries
failed to spread, and now only fifteen
states have them. The conditions and
the legal requirements under which
they are conducted differ widely.

Thus while the Presidential primary
seems to embody a perfect democratic
principle, it falls far short of democracy in practice. The basic purpose of
a primary, however, is not to measure

the general popularity of a candidate
but to permit the members of his own
party to express a choice. And even
this purpose is frustrated in some
states where members of a party vote
in the primary of their opposition to
defeat a stronger candidate and approve a weak one who can easily be
defeated. This practice tends to
destroy party responsibility.
