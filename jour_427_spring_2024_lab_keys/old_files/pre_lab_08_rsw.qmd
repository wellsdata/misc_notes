# Cleaning data with Google Sheets {#xl_sheets_cleaning}

This chapter will demonstrate some of the bedrock data cleaning skills using Google Sheets, techniques that can be used in Excel and other spreadsheets. We will normalize and clean data by deleting rows, stripping whitespace, making characters lowercase or uppercase. In addition, you will learn to split text to columns, a very handy tool for splitting up dates. 


Make a copy of your data before cleaning)

We will use a version of the Washington Post [police shooting data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13RohaTGgnUhxw5KMKT_BhZe45QQDz62gYbagwoztpLk/edit?usp=sharing) to conduct these exercises.


### Text to columns

We want to split up the date field into day, month and year. Currently, the format is 2015-01-02. Luckily, the fields all share a common separator, a hyphen, and we can ask Google Sheets to split all according to the hyphen. Other common separators are commas and spaces. 

First steps when modifying data: make a backup copy!
-   Left click on the tab "Police Shootings to Clean"
-   Select duplicate
-   Rename "Copy of Police Shootings to Clean" to "Original Police Shootings to Clean." Do not touch this version.

Time to split text to columns.
I am extra paranoid (for good reason) and so I always duplicate a date field before modifying it. Duplicate the date column (click on Column C, left click, copy, then Insert column to left, select new blank Column C and paste), save the copy as date-original.

-  Select date column
-  Select Data | Split text to columns
-  See a dialog box: Separator. Select Custom and type in a dash - and enter.
You now have the date field chopped up to year, month and day. Rename column E for month and column f for day.

```

### Normalizing

Scroll down the race_ethnicity column and you will see a number of different categories for the same thing: white, White, non Hispanic and Black, African Am. To see all the variations of categorical variables, create a filter and [check the different variables](assets/variables_sheets.gif){width="100%"}

This presents a big problem when you are trying to group and summarize based on these variable names. See [this chart](assets/bad_total_sheets.png){width="100%"}

We see white totals 44 and White, non Hispanic total 3,136. We want those to be together -- the total is 3,180 -- because they are the same thing. Also note that African Am totals 29 and Black totals 1,645, and we would want to combine those as well.

Let's fix it!

Before changing any data, let's work with a copy of the column.
-  Select race_ethnicity (Column k), left click, copy
-  Left click on Column K, insert column to right, paste
-  Rename as race_ethnicity2

Renaming variables. We will rename all "white" as "White, non Hispanic"
-  Filter race_ethnicity (Column K) to white 
-  in race_ethnicity2, write "White, non Hispanic" in the first column and copy down the list

[See how this process works](assets/sheets_normalizing.gif){width="100%"}


```{r normalize_gif, out.width="100%", echo=FALSE}

if (knitr::is_html_output()) knitr::include_graphics("assets/sheets_normalizing.gif")  
#![](assets/double_filter_Sheets.gif)
```

### Lowercase or Uppercase character conversion

Create a filter and notice two variations on Native American: NativeAm and nativeam. You can resolve these differences easily by converting all to Upper or Lower case text using the =UPPER or =LOWER functions.

-  To convert NativeAm to lower case, filter on race_ethnicity (Column K) for NativeAm.
-  In race_ethnicity2 (Column L), insert a blank column, and type the function =LOWER(K67) and hit enter. 

The result should be nativeam as the first entry in race_ethnicity2. 

See [this example](assets/lower_sheets.png){width="100%"}

### White space

One obnoxious feature of spreadsheet data is the invisible "white space" or hidden character or carriage returns that can impede your ability to group and summarize variables. Look at the age column. See how some numbers are flush left while most are flush right. The flush left data has hidden white space. You can fix this by clicking on individual cells and deleting the space around the number or you can do it with a function.

-  Select age (Column H), left click on Column H, insert column to right, rename as age2
-  In cell I2, type =TRIM(H2) and enter. Copy the formula down.

Note how all of the values have been normalized.

These are some of the basic go-to tools for data cleaning in Google Sheets, which can be adapted to Excel, R and other programming languages.
