" We hail it with satisfaction that a
more healthy public opinion in this quar-
ter seems developing, that reputable citi-
zens appear more disposed to bear an active
part in practical politics, and that' re-
form,'' free ballot,'' a fair account,' are becoming
under the more and
, pressure more
,
party watchwords. It is a purifying tend-
ency in a vital direction."
Equally pertinent is his denunciation of
the law's delays, especially in cases so
vitally affecting the public welfare. He
voices the feeling of all intelligent and
honorable citizens when he says:" A
prompt execution of the law's sentence,
after a fair trial had, is that which strikes
terror into evil- doers and satisfies the pub-
lice conscience The of this
. reverse among
us has brought reproach the adminis-
upon
tration of justice and given plausible
grounds for the application of lynch law."
Coming from Cardinal Gibbons, this advocacy
of these important principles will
command wide attention and unusual
weight.- Troy Times. carry
