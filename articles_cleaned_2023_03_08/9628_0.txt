" YES. I BEAT HIM."
HUSBAND ADMITS
Hall Says He Thrashed Old
Man for Attentions to
Wife.
THREAT TO LYNCH
FOLLOWED ATTACK
Glendale Citizens Angered by Sensational
Affray- Victim
Taken to Hospital.
" Yes, I beat him. I don't deny it.
After I had finished with my fists, I
took my wagon whip to him, as I claim
I had a right to do. I had warned him
to cease attentions to my wife."
In these words, Richard B. Hall, a
young husband of thirty years, described
the manner in which he met Thomas
Kalbfus, aged sixty- eight, in a lonely
spot near Glendale, a Washington sub-
urb, and horsewhipped him so severely
that the older man has been in serious
condition at Garfield Hospital until to
day.
Developments in the sensational af
fair revolving around the older man's
alleged attentions to Hall's young wife
have just become public. That a number
of enraged citizens of Glendale
talked freely of lynching the husband
after his arrest last Wednesday night,
also became known, and the story is
not denied either by Hall himself or
reputable citizens of this community.
Feeling Against Hall.
Nearly half a hundred friends of the
aged and beaten man were gathered
about the depot when Deputy Sheriff
Nicholson left with his prisoner for the
county seat. Since Hall's return home,
following his giving bonds Saturday
last, he has not been seen about the
village, and seems cognizant of the fact
that there is considerable feeling there
against him.
Kalbfus, who is a retired army officer
and pensioner, is the father of Samuel
Kalbfus, one of the assistant District
assessors, and Charles H. Kalbfus, a
clerk in the Postoffice Department. The
aged man had so far recovered today
as to warrant his removal from the hospital
to the home of one of his sons,
near Halpine, Montgomery country,
Md.
The stories of the sensational affair,
which has been the talk of Glendale
for a week, are as contradictory as is
possible for them to be.
According to combined current reports,
Hall was insanely jealous of the older
man. That this jealously was without
foundation, is the belief of many of
the citizens of the community. Mrs.
Hall herself today said that her husband's
actions were entirely unwarranted
, and that she did not justify
them.
Boarded With Halls.
Last summer Kalbfus boarded with
the Hall family, while the latter was
occupying the home of the old man's
the summer. It was that
son for then
the acquaintance began.
On the day of the assault Kalbfus was
in a store at Glendale, when Hall came
in. A few moments later the old man
left in the direction of his home, and
Hall was seen to follow.
It is said that Hall overtook Kalbfus
in a lonely ravine about a mile from
town, and, without a word, began to
vent his anger upon the old man. It is
related that he beat the ex- soldier unmercifully
about the face, kicked him,
and horsewhipped him. Kalbfus is said
to have made no effort to retallate, be
yond vainly endeavoring to escape from
his assailant.
All the while the two young children
of Hall were screaming from his nearby
wagon:" Don't beat grandpa," calling
Kalbfus the familiar pet name by
which he by was generally known.
