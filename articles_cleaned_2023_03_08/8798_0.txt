L. M. FRANK SLAYERS
UNKNOWN IS VERDICT
Witnesses Witnesses at at Inquest Inquest Fail to
Give Clew to Lynchers.
Marietta, Ga., Aug. 25.- After questioning
of eleven witnesses had failed
to elicit a single clew as to the identity
of any person connected with the
lynching of Leo M. Frank near this
city last Tuesday morning, a coroner's
jury returned a verdict that
Frank came to his death by hanging
at the hands of" parties unknown."
City and county officials testified that
they had endeavored diligently to get
at the facts of the lynching, but their
efforts had been of no avail.
" Of course, you know these things
are pretty close and are hard to find
out," said Mayor Dobbs of Marietta.
Deputy Sheriff Hicks and City Mar
shal Looney said they were working
hard on the case, but at this time
could throw no light on the identity
of the persons who participated in the
lynching.
The nearest to a disclosure as to
what happened in the oak grove near
the Frey gin came from J. A. Benson,
a Marietta merchant, who drove past
the place soon after the lynching par
ty had parked its automoviles on the
roadside and had led Frank to the
tree where death awaited him. Mr.
Benson said he had a" pretty good
suspicion" as to what was going on
but he did not stop to see it and he
did not recognize anybody in the
party.
