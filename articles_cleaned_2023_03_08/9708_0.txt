STORMED THE JAIL.
The Omaha Mob Attempts to Rescue Its
Arrested Leaders.
OMAHA, Oct. 12.-R. G. Bloom, Captain
John O'Donohue, H. H. Brandies, Ed.
Fitzgerald, Ed. Netchaefer, Patrick
O'Horne and John Fritz, seven of the
mob that lynched Coe, were arrested
Saturday evening and taken to the
county jail. They are all charged with
murder in the first degree and were re
bail.
7:30 the jail was surrounded by a
of 500, and word was sent to County
L ney Mahoney unless the men were
released on bail they would be taken
from the jail by force. Mahoney replied
that under no circumstances would the
men be released.
The crowd at once made preparations
for storming the jail. They secured a big
steel rail and had started to use it as a
battering ram on the east door, when a
committee of citizens appeared at the
jail door and made a proposition to the
crowd to have a committee appointed to
go through the jail and ascertain if the
men were inside.
This suited the crowd and when the
committee reported that five of the men
had been released and the other two had
been taken out of town for safe keeping
the mob dispersed. The city and county
officials seem to be utterly paralyzed
the results of Friday night's work
over and the developments of Saturday night.
