OF THE USUAL ORDER
A TYPICAL LYNCHING
states the case so successfully that
we do not hesitate to adopt the
words, giving due credit:
" The five negroes lynched near
1Abany, Ga., were' suspected of
having been connected with the kill
ling of the Sheriff of Lee county.' A
sixth, against whom it is believed
there is a better case, was not in the
jail, having been removed for safe
keeping.
" Here we have a typical lynching.
The mob did not know that the suspects
were guilty, and did not want
to find out the truth. It wanted
the excitement of a killing bee and
got it. The circumstance that the
only suspect whose case looked
enough to make the officers think bad
he should be removed for safekeep
ing was absen t, didn't matter much.
There was excitement enough in killing
the five minor prisoners.
" There's an anti- lynching bill now
pending in the Legislature. It aims
at preventing just such wanton and
savage acts as that which
in Georgia.". occurred
