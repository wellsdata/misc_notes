scouring the woods for a distance of
about forty- five miles in search of the
riotous cotton pickers, Sheriff Der
rick and returned here
posse
brought
yesterday They with
.
them three negroes. As expected,
there was no truth in the reports sent
out from Helena that nine men had
been taken from the sheriff and
lynched. So far as known Ed Peyton,
who was shot by the Officers Tuesday,
and Ben Patterson, who was taken
from Deputy Mills and lynched Wednesday
night, were the only ones killed.
The sensational reports which have in
some instances placed the number of
killed as high as thirteen are based on
imagination only. Everything is now
quiet at the of rioting and cotton
picking is going scene on steadily,
