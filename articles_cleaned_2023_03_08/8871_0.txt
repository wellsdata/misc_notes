NEGRO LYNCHED IN ARKANSAS.
Jack Harris Hanged for Assault
ing White Man.
REPUBLIC SPECIAL.
Clarendon. Ark., June 25.- Jack Harris, a
negro, who assaulted John Coburn, a white
farmer living eight miles east of Clarendon
, last Sunday night, was taken from his
guard this morning at 1 o'clock by fifty
masked men and hanged.
For better security, the Sheriff had placed
Harris in charge of a deputy and secreted
them in a barn. The mob demanded to be
admitted into the jail, which request was
readily granted. While one part of the mob
was looking through the jail, another por
tion of it went to the barn, took the negro
and hanged him.
An advance member the guard had
spied on the Sheriff's movements of.
Harris was a tenant on John Coburn's
farm. Sunday he asked to ride a mule be
longing to Coburn and was refused. Later
he took the mule and rode it all day. Co
burn reprimanded him, and the negro assaulted
him with a scantling from which
protruded a large spike. Coburn's arm was
broken, and he was beaten about the
shoulders, head and arms, and would have
been killed but for the appearance of his
wife with a shotgun
Coburn snapped the gun at the
negro, but it was empty. fleeing
