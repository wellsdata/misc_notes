A Cincinnati telegram says: Ow-
ing to the incendiary advertisement
calling for 1000 men at Court and
Sveamore streets at 8:30 o'clock this
morning" ready for work" there was
well- founded apprehension that a
mob was gathering to lynch the
prisoners, Jackson and Walling, on
the way from the jail to the police
court. The crowd did assemble but
a heavy relay of police was on hand
and no concentration was permitted.
The prisoners had been quietly removed
to the city hall two hours be
fore the time when it was supposed
they would leave the jail. The third
appearance of Jackson and Walling
in the police court to- day drew to
, the court room a jostling, curious
crowd .. The prisoners were required
to remain not more than half
a minute, for the counsel had agreed
to continue the
27. The prisoners were safely re
tusned to jail, the wagon being fol
lowed
at a run by a few over curious
boys.-
