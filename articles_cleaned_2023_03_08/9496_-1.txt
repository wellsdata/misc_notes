LYNCHING AND CRIME.
The Selma Times is the only Ala
bama newspaper, so far as the News
is aware, that approves of lynching.
In an editorial on the Scottsboro
lynching it declared that the mob did
right. The Times seems to think that
there is too much sympathy wasted
on the brute that is lynched and not
innocent victim." So
enough on the
far as southern opposition to lynch
ing is concerned the Times is entirely
wrong in its suggestion.
There is no sympathy wasted on
the brute who commits the crime ex
northern fanatics.
No one in
cept by
the south feels sorry for him or deplores
his death except that his punishment
was effected outside of the
pale of the law. Crime is just as de
testable and guilt as odious to those
who stand for the supremacy of the
law as it is to those who believe in
mob violence.
Experience has proven that lynch
ing does not reduce crime. No one
has respect for the verdict of the
mob. The brute with depraved instincts
feels that the mob, if he com
mits a crime, is just about as likely
in the passion of the moment, to
select an innocent victim as it is the
culprit. Manifestiations of mob violence
are incentives to crime by the
, hope of immunity which they hold
out. Since lynching does not de
crease the crime it has no prop to sup
port it. Again lawlessness breeds
, rapidly. One form of law violation
unrebuked begets a contempt for the
fact
general In
. law in. the history
of mankind teaches us that license
to
means barbarism, and law is the mark
of civilization. The utter irresponsibility
of the mob is not more strikingly
shown than in the increase of
causes of lynching. Criminal assault
is now in the minority. The causes
range from that heinous crime down
to the most trival offense.
There is little room for argument.
however, on the subject of lynching.
It is a question that does not admit
of a discussion on its merits. To de
fend lynching is tantamount to admit
ting that society is a failure and that
it were better for man to return to
the his primitive state.
It is not the intention of the News
the to debate, therefore, the subject of
ynching, but to assure the Times and
all advocates of lynching that love of
the law and respect and obediencce to
the courts do entail condonation
of crime.- Birmingham not News.
