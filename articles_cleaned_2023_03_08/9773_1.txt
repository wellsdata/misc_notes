Woman Thrashes a Tramp.
Mrs.
Wilkes- Barre, Pa., Oct. 15.
-
John Snyder, of Riverside, near here,
who weighs 275 pounds, mostly muscle,
dusted the roadside with a tramp who
had attacked her. When she was done
with the man he looked as though he
had been in a wreck. The tramp went
to the Snyder home and, after having
been given something to eat, discover
ed that Mrs. Snyder was alone, and
attacked her. She knocked the fellow
down, picked him up again, ran him to
the road and held him with one hand
while she pounded him with the other.
Neighbors, hearing the man's shrieks,
ran to the scene and wanted to lynch
the man, but Mrs. Snyder insisted that
punishment she had given was se
the vere enough and he was released.
