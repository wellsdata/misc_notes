LYNCHINGS AND ANARCHY.
During the past three or four
months nearly every important pa
per in the country has had some
disting to say about lynching. While
by far the larger part of the
press of all sections is op.
posed to this form of lawlessness,
some editors have accomplished the
remarkable feat of riding horses
going in directions- in one
breath both denouncing anarchy and
upholding lynching, forgetting that
they are twin evils, differing not
in kind but only in degree. The
anarchist wishes to abolish all law
while the advocate of lynching would
nullify all laws that do not suit his
feelings and passions. The two
evils must be eradicated, and law
everywhere recognized as rightfully
supreme before our civilization will
rest upon an enduring basis.
In this connection it is Humiliating
to record that in North Carolina in
the past eleven years, there have
been 50 per cent. more lynchings
than legal executions- 18 of the
former to 12 of the latter. But we
believe that there is an awakening
of public opinion in this matter. Certainly

of lynch law is smaller
ever before. than
