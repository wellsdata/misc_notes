Union City, Tenn., Oct. 21.- Colonel
R. Z. Taylor and Captain Quinten
Rainkin, prominent attorneys of Tren
ton, were taken from Ward's hotel, at
Walnut Log, fifteen miles from here,
by masked night riders and murdered
.
Captain Rankin's body was found
riddled with bullets and hanging from
a tree one mile from the hotel.
Efforts to find the body of Colonel
Taylor have been futile thus far, but it
is believed that he was also killed.
Sheriff Eastwood and a posse left
Union City for the scene of the mur
der. If they meet any of the night
riders it is expected that a pitched
battle will be fought. Sheriff Haynes,
of Lake county, is also on his way to
the scene with a posse from
ville. Tipton
The trouble that resulted in the
death of Captain Rankin and the prob
able murder of Colonel Taylor was
caused by the passage of an act by the
regulating fishing in Reel
Foot lake, a short distance from Wal
nut Log.
Mr. Ward, manager of the hotel at
Walnut Log, telephoned Sid Waddell,
a stockholder of the West Tennessee
Land company, that about twenty- five
masked night riders came to his hotel
at midnight. They lined up outside the
hotel, pulled out their revolvers, and
called Taylor and Rankin. The men
did not suspect trouble and came down
immediately.
As the attorneys passed into the
front yard of the hotel the night rid
ers covered them with their revolvers,
and before they could retreat they
were seized, put on horses and placed
under guard.
The night riders then took up their
march from the hotel, turning down
the road toward Reel Foot lake. The
guests at the hotel in a few minutes
lost the sound of hoof beats and noth
ing more was learned of the fate of
Captain Rankin and Colonel Taylor un
til morning.
Going to the edge of Reel Foot lake,
the bandits put a rope about Captain
Rankin's neck and strung him up from
a limb on the bank of the lake, for the
fishing privileges of which he had con
tended. The masked men stepped back
and opened fire on the swinging body,
riddling it with bullets.
They took Colonel Taylor to some
other spot. Search has failed to re
veal a trace of him.
The trouble between inhabitants en
the banks of Reel Foot lake and Col
onel Taylor and Captain Rankin originated
several years ago, when the two
latter men organized the West Tennessee
Land company, bought Reel
Foot lake from non- resident property
owners and made regulations of their
own concerning fishing privileges.
Colonel Taylor also secured the pas
sage in the legislature of an act mak
ing it a misdemeanor to fish in the
lake without paying a heavy fee.
Fearing trouble, Captain Rankin and
Colonel Taylor had remained away
from the vicinity of the lake for
time. Recently, however, they heard some
that the feeling against them had
somewhat subsided. There were some
legal papers at Walnut Log which
needed attention, and the attorneys
went there to see about them.
A man named Powell, who hauls fish
from Walnut Log to Hickman, is said
to have been forced to accompany the
mob. Powell says that after kill
ing Rankin a vote was taken regarding
the disposition to be made of Taylor.
During the dispute Taylor made a
dash, jumped into the bayou and start
ed to swim across. A number of shots
were fired at him. In the confusion
Powell slipped away and brought back
the story of the escape or attempted
escape of Taylor.
Searchers found the trees on the
edge of the bayou clipped by bullets,
and there were deep footprints in the
mud along the shore. On the other side.
of the bayou there was a single foot
print, and some think this may be the
track of Colonel Taylor.
Governor Patterson arrived at Humboldt
and held a consultation with
citizens of Trenton, who came down
to meet him. Governor Patterson announced
that he had offered a$ 10,000
reward and would visit the scene
person. in
