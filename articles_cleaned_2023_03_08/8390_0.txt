Quite a sensation was created in Jack
last
son Monday by R. D. Lowry neph-
a
,
ew of the Governor, making a brutal as
sanit on his young wife at the residence
of Mayor Henry where she was stopping
for protection on acconut of
previous
maltreatment. It is stated that Lowry
entered the house and on meeting his
wife felled her to the floor with a bottle
which he carried in his hand, whereupon
the Mayor came to her rescue with a re
volver and the brutal husband fled hat
less into the street and made his escape.
Young Lowry is the same individual who
in company with his cousin Robert, some
time ago raised such a racket on the cars
because the conductor refused to recognize
his right to ride on the Governor's
illegal family pass, and his conduct last.
Monday excited very general indignation
and suggestions of a coat of tar and
feathers and appeal to Judge Lynch were
very freely made in the event of his
Sature. cap-
