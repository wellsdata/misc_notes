Sam Hall, a negro who had been
run out of his doggery at Newport
News last Thursday by three Indiana
soldiers, after reaching his buggy and
was fleeing, shot back at his pursuers
and killed one and wounded another.
It is now feared the Indianians will
lynch the negro. They will probably
do so. Lynching of negroes takes
place only where there are negroes.
The white people who engage in these
past times do not belong to any sec-
tion. They are like the poor always
with us.,
