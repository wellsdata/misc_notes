SURRENDERED.
Hardy, who killed Geo. Mounts
and shot Ellis in the shoulder and
also shot two of the latter's fin
gers off, surrendered to the Mingo
county authorities last week. It
was feared that a mob would lynch
the prisoner at Williamson and he
was taken to Russell county, Va.,
for safe keeping. The shooting
was done near Gray, on the Ken
valley.tucky side, of Tug river, and was
we understand without provocation
Mounts was an inoffensive man,
well known by many of our readers
having been in Ceredo a number of
times this Spring, and having
sold timber to the J. H.
Lumber Co. at different times Milleuder.
