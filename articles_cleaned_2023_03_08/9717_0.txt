COURAGEOUS CONSTABLE.
Saved a Negro From Being Lynched
In New York.
Rochester, N. Y. Aug. 2.- George Frank
lin, colored, attempted to assault Mrs.
Mary Steinmiller, who lives near Brighton,
one of Rochester's suburbs, Saturday
evening, and a mob of men and boys tried
to lynch him when he was finally found
last night hiding in a barn near the vil
lage. He was identified by the woman
and the mob made a rush for him.
He was taken back to the barn where
he had been captured, where another
crowd was in waiting. News of his identification
had preceded his arrival and
parties who had been following his tracks
across the field traced him back to the
scene of the alleged assault.
Franklin, still protesting his innocence
and asking for protection, was shoved
back into the barn and a call was sent
for the constable. Word that he was on
the way passed around, and, as one of the
Lynch him!" a of
crowd shouted" coil
rope was brought out, and, despite the
frantic struggles of Franklin and his protectors
, was thrown about his neck.
Everybody within reach seized the rope
and started to drag Franklin out. He was
forced to his knees and dragged across
the floor out into the open, and one of the
mob climbed into a tree ready to pass the
end of the rope across a convenient limb,
when Constable Schroeder appeared on the
the scene, and fighting his way through
the crowd, drew his revolver and threatened
to shoot the first man who made a
Imove to harm the negro. The constable's
determined air and the revolver had a deterrent
effect upon the crowd, although
those on the edges still shouted to go on
the lynching. Other officers arrived
and with the negro was hurried to the city jail.
