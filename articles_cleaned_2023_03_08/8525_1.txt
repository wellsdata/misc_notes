LEWISTON, Idaho, Sept. 22.- Five
Chinamen, implicated in the murder of
Daniel Frazer and the robbery in Pierce
City, were taken from jail by citizens
last night and hung to trees.
They were armed with repeating
rifles, and each had a sack drawn over
his head with holes cut for the nose,
eyes and mouth. They were thus completely
disguised, and presented a fright-
ful appearance. The Chinamen fled in
terror from their houses, which were
then burned.

neers of Southern Idaho, was well
known and respected, had a room in the
rear of the store, which was entered on
the night of the 11th inst. He was murdered
and his body horribly mutilated.
Au attempt was then made to blow
open the safe, which was unsuccessful.
Tracks outside the building showed that
Chinamen had done the deed. In the
next five days fifteen Chinese were ar
rested, and finally five confessed to the
deed These were taken out and summarily
. disposed of.
