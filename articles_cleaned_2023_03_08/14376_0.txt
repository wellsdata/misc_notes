Negro Pass Peally
For Indulging Lust
COLORED MAN LYNCHED IN THE
SOUTH FOR RAPE OF
WHITE GIRL.
NASHVILLE, Tenn., Sept. 5.
-Another of the unlawful acts
which have terrorized this sec
tion of the country in the past
was perpetrated near here last
night when Mose Gunn a negro,
was lynched by a mob of infuriated
citizens of this city and the
surrounding country. The
rea
son for the lynching was that
the
negro was accused of the
rape of Madge Gilmer, a white
girl 15 years of age.
The crime is said to have
been committed in one of the
railroad yards in the outskirts
of the city yesterday afternoon,
or in broad daylight. Yesterday
evening as some of the railroad
men were returning from their
work, they discovered the girl
in a box car in a practically un
conscious state. She was revived
, however, sufficiently to
disclose the identity of the man
who had outraged her, and an
immediate pursuit was organized.
When found the colored man
denied all knowledge of the
crime. His captors, however,
took him to the home of the
girl and she positively identified
him.
The sheriff of the county was
not notified that crime had been
committed until it was all over.
It is understood that there will
be an investigation of the conditions
surrounding the
rence. occur
