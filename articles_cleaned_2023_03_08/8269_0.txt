FARMERS LYNCH A CHEAT.
He Had Paid Them for Cattle With
Worthless Checks.
CINCINNATI, O., March 20.- A Cynthiana,
Ky., dispatch says that Benjamin Grewell
was lynched at Robinson station last night
by a mob of about twenty persons. Two
years ago Grewell defrauded farmers in
that locality by buying stock and paying
for it with bogus checks. He then fled to
the mountains, but ventured back recently
thinking his evil deeds had been forgotten.,
