Unjust and Indefensible.
Eutaw Whig and Observer.
We are opposed to lynch law in any
shape, and think the law should visit
the severest penalty upon all officers
who, through cowardice, friendship or
sympathy allow prisoners to be taken
from them and lynched. But we do
think some of the strictures passed
upon the Sheriffs in the debate in the
Constitution Convention, were utterly
unjust and, and reflected
little credit upon indefensible those who made them.
