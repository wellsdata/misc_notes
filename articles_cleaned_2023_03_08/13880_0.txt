NEGROES GUARD JAIL
AND PREVENT LYNCHING
Stanford, Ky .. Jail Scene of
Unusual Doings
Stanford, Ky., Feb. 16.- A mob of
negroes heavily armed stood on guard
outside the jail here last night prepared
to resist any attempt of a whit
mob to lynch the blacks, Louis Gregory
and Curley Johnson, held for shooting
and robbing three white tobacco
farmers on the Danville pike last Monday
night. It is believed the action of
the negro mob had the effect of ward
ing or an attempt to lynch the prisoners
.
At midnight a posse of armed white
men who are neighbors of the high-
waymen's victims drove into town and
scouted about the jail. They advised
against an attempt to storm the jail, it
is believed, because the slightest mov
against the negro prisoners would have
resulted in a fierce clash between the
races.
Sheriff McCarthy and a squad of
deputies stood guard in front of the
jail during the night. They paid no at
attention to the negroes' demonstration
until several shots were fired in
to the black camp. There is a bitter
feeling against the negroes in this vicinity
, and the whites are going
fully armed. about
