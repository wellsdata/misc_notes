The Nebraska City Lynching.
Denver Republican.
A mob at Nebraska City has lynched Shel
lenberger, who was convicted of murdering
his own child. Although mob law is always
wrong, there are times when it assumes such
phases as to make it almost excusable. Such
a case was that of Shellenberger, if he was
indeed guilty of the crime of which he was
convicted in view of the fact that there was
danger of his escape. The man who will
murder his own child has no right to live a
single moment after the commission of the
offense. In this case Shellenberger, just be
fore he was strung up, accused his wife of
being guilty the murder, protesting at the
same time his of own innocence.
