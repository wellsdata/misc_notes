Murderer Lynched
Bismarck, S. D., November 15.- An
interesting legal question is presented
by yesterday's lynching of three of the
Spicer murderers. Two of the
men,
Holytrack and Ireland, were the
state's witnesses and without their testimony
the state has no case against
the two surviving Black
suspects,
hawk and Defender. There is there
fore now no possibility of convicting
them before any tribunal for the rea
son that the state's witnesses, self
murder,
confessed accomplices of the
are dead. At the coming term of court
when the two men are arraigned for
trial they will be dismissed. The opinion
of a large number of people in Em
mon counties that Blackhawk was the
instigator of the crime. If he is dis
charged it is predicted that unless he
has an escort out of the county he will
share the fate of his comrades in
crime. Defender, the other survivor,
has consumption and it is predicted
cannot ive a year. It is claimed that
the majority of the lynchers were from
Winona, where the crime was commit
ted, but nothing certain is known. Two
of the men hanged were wards of the
government and the lynching
may
bring about some action by the government
to discover by they
were lynched. whom
