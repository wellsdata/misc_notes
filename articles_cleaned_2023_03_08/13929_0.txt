A BLOT ON OUR CIVILIZATION
The record of 62 lynchings in the United States
during 1918, compiled by Tuskegee Institute, shows
that while we have been engaged as a people in mak
ing the world safe for democracy we have done noth
ing more toward removing a hideous blot from our
civilization and making the south safe for our citizens
of the Negro race. For it is no answer to say
that if the Negro behaves himself he will not be
lynched. The summary killing of" the wrong man
is a familiar sequel to the story of a clime in the
south. The maddened mob is satisfied as long as it
lynches somebody, and that somebody was a Negro
in 58 of the 62 cases of mob violence reported for the
year just ending. Fourteen of the victims were ac
eused of complicity in murder, accused not by a grand
jury after careful investigation but by common ru
mor. Six were alleged to have made threats to kill
an offense not punishable by death even if guilt is
proved. As usual the state of Georgia held the rec
ord for the largest number of mob murders, 18
the 62. of
In the light of these ghastly figures, President Wil
son's remarkable exhortation to the country to abolish
the lynching evil is seen to have been fully justified.
As he pointed out at the time, the murders by the
mob, uncondemned by public sentiment, in certain
sections of the country, afford the opportunity to our
foes to question the sincerity of our motives as a na
tion. Those that would reform others must them
selves have clean hands. Many schemes have been
suggested for coping with the evil, including that of
federal interference. But notwithstanding our na-
tion's supposed steady advancement toward the ideal
democracy, we suffer this blot to remain. Until it is
removed our claim to the attainment of the highest
civilization cannot be granted.- Pittsburgh
