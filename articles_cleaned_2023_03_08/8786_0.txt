TWO NEGROES LYNCHED
Charleston, Mo., was the scene of
a double lynching yesterday after-
noon between 4 and 5 o'clock. Al
most the entire populace was out, as
were farmers for miles around, to wit-
ness the affair. The victims were
two negroes who had held up, robbed
and murdered William Fox, a prominent
farmer of Mississippi county,
the deed was committed Saturday
night.
William Fox lived about five miles
from Charleston. He was in the
town transacting business during Sat-
urday afternoon and evening, and
about 11 o'clock go into his wagon
to return home, when two negroes
asked him the privilege of a ride out
as far as the place they said they
were employed, about three miles
from town. He consented and they
got into the wagon. At a point about
half a mile out of town they held
a pistol to his head and demanded
his money which he refused to give
up. He grabbed one of the negroes
and had a tussel with him, the other
negro then fired a shot into his body
and he fell to the bed of the wagon
mortally wounded the shot having
gone through his body. The negroes,
after rifling his pockets obtaining
about$ 15 left him. Not being able
to drive, Fox started the horses
going toward home and at the first
farm house called for help. From
this house Sheriff Culp of Charleston,
was notified by telephone. He im-
medately got out his two blood
hounds and in a short time had the
two negroes in the city jail. They
were found in the barn near the
house where Fox lay dying. Fox died
about 8 o'clock yesterday morning.
The news of the tragedy spread
rapidly and groups of men in angry
mood began to form as early as sun-
rise. Telephones were busy
at all
the farm houses for miles around
Charleston, and it was not long
fore hundreds of teams were pouring
into the town loaded with angry men,
bent upon avenging the deed.
A number of business men went to
the sheriff and made a demand for
the prisoners. The officer informed
them they could not get them. The
sheriff summoned a posse and prepared
to resist the mob which began
to form by hundreds, then by thous-
ands. About 4 o'clock in the after
noon members of the mob, procuring
a heavy piece of timber, began the
work of battering in the first door of
the jail. The sheriff and his posse
made an attempt to stay the proceedings
by firing several shots in
the air; but the mob surrounded them
and deprived them of their weapons.
While the battering down of the
first door was going on States Attor-
ney Moore Hall ordered the men to
stop and caught hold of the ram near
its" business" end and being jostled
by the angry workers he narrowly
escaped being rammed against the
iron door and crushed to death. He
realized his narrow escape and re
tired from the scene. It was but a
short time before the mob reached
, the inner cell door.
In the meantime members of the
mob had been talking with the frightened
negroes. each of whom
con
fessed, but each said the other had
fired the fatal shot.
When the door of the cell contalt
ing the murderers was battered down
they were taken out into the yard
of the court house which is opposite
the city jail and one of them was
hung from the limb of a tree. While
this was being done several
of the mob took the other negro members in a
wagon, telling him he would receive
better treatment if he would show
them where they had thrown the re
volver after shooting Fox. He prom
ised to do so.
In passing the railroad station on
the way to the scene of the shooting
some one in the crowd that followed
shouted it don't make any difference
what had been promised he would be
hung anyway. The negro rose up
and said if that was the case, he
might as well be hung now. At this
the mob jerked him out of the wagon
and strung him up to the art of a
telegraph pole.
The hanging of both negroes was
witnessed by many woryen and chil
dren and nearly all the white people
of the town and surrounding country
who gave words of encouragement to
those who performed the work.
One of the incidents that had stir
red up the people happened when the
wife of William Fox arrived in town
without knowing what had happened
to her husband and on being told
that her husband had been murdered
she fell to the street in a swoon.
Sheriff Cupp notified Governof
Hadley of the pending trouble, and
he ordered out the Cape Girardeau
company, but they were not expected
to arrive
at Charleston until 10
o'clock last night.
It is reported that all the telegraph
and telephone wires leading out of
Charleston had been cut early in the
afternoon to prevent any outside interference
.
A number of the hot heads, shortly
after the execution, proposed to burn
all the negroes out of the town and
some demonstration is said to have
been made in the negro settlement
with the result that a great many
negroes left the town yesterday some
of them coming to Cafro.
The temper of the people of Char
beleston was at fever heat yesterday
afternoon. A negro barber who was
standing in front of his shop with a
pocket knife in his, hand was told to
put it up by a white man. He wasn't
quick enough in loing it and a crowd
surrounded him, beat him up and ran
him away from his place.
Who the negroes were could not
be learned. One report is that they
were strangers in Charleston, having
come there from Tennessee.
A report late last night that there
had been another outbreak and an
other negro lynched could not be
verified.
It was felt in Cairo yesterday morn
ing by many that a lynching was like.
ly to take place in Charleston in the
afternoon, and a few people from
here went over on the afternoon
train, but did not arrive there in
time to witness the affair.
