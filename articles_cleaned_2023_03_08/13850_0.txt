ELOPED WITH WHITE GIRL.
Negro Taken From Jail and
Lynched in Arkansas.
Dumas, Ark., July 6.- A negro named
Joe Woodman of Rives, Ark., was lynched
here early today after having eloped with
the daughter of J. S. Small, a white man.
The elopement occurred yesterday, and
Sheriff James Gould of Pine Bluff caught
the couple at Tamo on board a train. The
girl was returned to her parents and the
negro was placed in jail here. All was
quiet during the night, but today the jail
was found open and the negro's
body dangled broken from a tree a mile distant.
