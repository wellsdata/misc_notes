THERE is talk of convening the legislature
in extra session to urdo the act
by which certain criminals are escaping
the penalty of the law. It is a questionable
proceeding but possibly better
,
than lynch law, which is almost certain
to prevail should the criminal law provetration
as ineffectual as it is reported to be.
When the people are compelled to take
things into their own handa to secure
protection to life and limb and
property,
to that and the law
cure peace quiet
should secure, the reenlts are terrible
and without remorse. It looks 88
though there were st empt to drive
the people to s last an resort.
