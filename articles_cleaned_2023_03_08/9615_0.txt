SLAYER LYNCHED BY MOB
Colored Man Dragged From
Hospital Bed At Salisbuy
And Hanged
Dragged from a hospital cot where
he lay ill from self- inflected wounds,
a colored man was lynched in front
of the Wicomico county court house
at Salisbury Friday night, less than
three hours after he had confessed
the murder of his employer, Daniel
J. Elliott, aged 67 years.
After hanging the colored man,
Matthew Williams, aged 35, his
body was cut down, gasoline poured
over it, and set or fire.
State's Attorney Levin C. Bailey
said Williams had confessed to shoot
ing to death Danial J. Elliott, 67, in
the office of his basket and crate
making plant at 2.30 P. M. Friday.
Bailey declared Williams said he
killed Elliott because the latter was
" paying him only 15 cents an hour."
After killing Elliott, one of the
most widely know business men on
the Eastern Shore, Williams fired a
bullet into his chest and was later
shot in the head by Flliott's son,
James Elliott, as he attempted to
flee.
At first it was reported Williams
had killed himself after the murder
of Elliottf but when it was learned
he was in the hospital sullen crowds
began to gather and the negro was
finally dragged from his cot and
hanged to a tree.
Maryland's last lynching previous
to that at Salisbury Friday night
occurred on Christmas night 1911, at
Brooklyn, then part of Anne Arundel
county, when a mob of white men
stormed the jail, which was without
police protection, dragged King
Johnson, colored, out and shot him
to death a few blocks distant. The
previous day he had shot and killed
Frederick A. Schwab in a pool
at Fairfield. room
