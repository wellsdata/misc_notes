Jim Crow Complaint.
The railroad commission has re-

charging that the steamboats plying

accommodations for white and colored
people. This is the only complaint
of the kind that has ever been
made against a steamboat, and the
commission will take up the matter
at its next meeting. It will, of
course, go as far as its authority will
permit in the matter and will com
pel separate accommodations to be
provided the passengers of the
