The Carmack Killing.
Another favorite and brilliant son
of this pleasant Southland has fallen
at the hands of a political enemy
Ex Senator Carmack, of Tennessee,
a man in the prime of life and beloved
by a great portion the Nation, was
shot down like a dog in the streets of
Nashville because he had in the pa
per he edited said things annoying
to the father of the slayer.
Following on the heels of a heated
State campaign in which Mr Carmack
was a defeated dandidate for Governor
, the affair has aroused more than
the usual attention over just killing a
man, that the inhabitants of Tennessee
customarily exhibit.
Much ado is being made by the
bombastic officials in a senseless and
useless so called trial of the murder
er, but an onlooker and student of the
history of crime in that State, knows
full well that nothing will come of all
this ado.
Human life is little valued in Tennessee
or Florida. As an illustration
theref one has only to recall the half
dozen murders in this section within
the past six months, for which no one
has been called to account, to prove
the assertion.
So why have the farce of a trial
the Carmack case? Why not let the
widow and close friends of the
murdered statesman mourn over their
loss without the added horrors of
having it retold and expatiated upon
before a crowd of maudlin sight seer's,
and exploited over and over again
by the press? Nothing will come of
it all. Justice will be travestied and
made subordinate to lynch law, while
his sorrowing family must suffer all
the bitterness of the unnatural,
uncalled for death of
one
who was all the world to them.
Shame on a government that through
repeated permission of assasinations
and mob law makes possible the
murder of such gifted national
as Ex senator Carmack. citizens
