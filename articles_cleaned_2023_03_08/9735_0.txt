WILL NOT SEEK TO
PUNISH LYNCHERS
BELLEVILLE, Ill., June 9.- Although
the crowd of men which lynched David
S. Wyatt, the negro school teacher who
shot Charles Hertel, county superintendent
of schools, at Belleville Saturday
night, worked on the jail without
masks for six hours, in view of hundreds
, including all the city and county
officials, and although the few men who
did the killing are known to scores, it
is unlikely their prosecution will result
.
State Attorney Farmer said to
day that he had not been able to find
anvbody who would identify any of the
lynchers. In the main, Belleville views
the lynching with complacency, and
there is no general disposition manifested
to exact a rigid investigation at
the hands of the authorities, none
is looked for. and
