throwing a rock at Albright and his skull
was fractured. This morning Smith's
body was found hanging to the bridge
across Black river, riddled with bullets.
After the trouble of yesterday Smith
arrested and placed
was in jail
At 1:30 this morning a masked mob
broke down the outer door of the jail,
battered the steel door to the prisoner's
cage in, and in spite of the man's plea for
mercy took him across the river and
lynched him.
The coroner's jury returned a verdict
that the deceased came to his death by
strangulation at the hands of unknown
parties. Mr. condition is very
critical and he Albright's will probably die.
