Rald Negro Rioters.
To- day, when it was learned that
young Stockley had died, a number
of white men armed themselves, and
with Chief of Police Ellis and other
officers entered the colored section
and raided the house which was said
to be the headquarters of the negro
rioters. Three men alleged to be the
ringleders, were arrested and taken to
the Sussex county jail.
Earl Richards, a 15- year- old white
boy, stole his father's revolver and
captured George Wright, a negro, for
whom the authorities have been look
ing for over a year. Richards compelled
the negro to hold up his
until the hands
officers arrived. Wright is
said to be wanted in Virginia for the
alleged murder of a white boy.
Officers are endeavoring to apprehend
the negro who fired the fatal
shot at young Stockley. Open threats
have been made of a lynching
he is caught. when
