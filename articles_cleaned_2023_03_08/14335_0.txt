CARROLLTON, III., March 1.- Guarded
by four companies of State militia to protect
him from a mob determined on lynch
ing, Albert Shenkle, who, on December
25 last, assaulted the 16- year- old daughter
of Charles H. Giller of Carrollton, was
early to- day taken from the County Jail
at Springfield and brought to Carrollton
on a special Chicago and Alton train.
Within an hour after arrival Shenkle had
pleaded guilty, had been given an indeterminate
sentence by Judge Owen
Thompson and was on his way to the penitentiary
at Chester.
Apparently nearly the whole population
of the town was gathered around the de
pot and along the streets leading to the
courthouse, but the troops, a
cordon around the train as soon as it
stopped, surrounding Shenkle, accompanied
by Sheriff Conlee, when he alight
ed from the cars, and prevented any hos
demonstration, if any had been
tile planned.
