ish crimes against women were more
frequent than they are now, public
sentiment was usually on the side of
the lynchers. But conditions have im
proved and the attitude of the people
toward lynching has changed. Every
nian charged with any kind of felony
should be tried and punished by law
and without the law's delays.
Lynching reacts upon the community
in which it takes place. Lawlessness
unrestrained is like a corroding
ulcer. It eats into our boasted civilization
and every manifestation of mob
action is far- reaching in its brutalizing
effect on society in general. Moral
standards are lowered and respect for
law is. reduced to a minimum.
The good people of Georgia and the
good people of all the other states
where lynchings have occurred should
rise up in a determined effort to ban
ish Judge Lynch forever.
Georgia surely needs a campaign of
education and a remolding of public
sentiment. That state can ill afford
to have a repetition of its lynching
record for 1918.
