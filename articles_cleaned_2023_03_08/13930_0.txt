GEORGIA MOB LYNCHES
NEGRO, BURNS CHURCHES
EASTMAN, Ga- The charred body
of Eli Cooper, a Negro, was found to
day in the ashes of a Negro church,
burned by incendiaries this week.
Three other Negro churches and a
Negro lodge in this section were burn
ed Tuesday night. The acts of violence
followed reports that the Negroes
planned to" rise up and wipe
out the white people," and that Cooper
remarked the Negroes had been" run
over for fifty years, but this will all
change in thirty days." The burned
churches and lodge rooms were said
to have been the scenes of mass meet
recently during which the uprisings
ing of Negroes was discussed.
