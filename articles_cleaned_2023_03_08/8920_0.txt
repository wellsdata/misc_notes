this city be assigned to speak at
several points in the State of Missouri
. I think it would be wise to
comply with the request as Senator
Allain is doubtless one of the best
campaign speakers that we have.
He is of wide experience and has
the faculty of reaching all classes
of people without antagonizing any.
He is an orator of high grade and
thoroughly acquainted with the
campaign issues. I do not think a
better selection could be made
among colored speakers for Missouri
. Favorable reports from the
County Central Committeemen and
the people always follow his meet
ings wherever we have assigned hinu
in Illinois.
I take pleasure, therefore, in
recommending Mr. Allain as the
proper man tol assign.
Yours respectfully,
JORDAN CHAVIS,
Chairman, Colored Voters of Ills.
THE CITY COUNCIL OF CHICAGO
WENT ON RECORD AGAINST
MOB AND LYNCH LAW.
The following Resolution which
was introduced by Ald. Charles
Alling, was adopted by the City
Council Monday evening:
Whereas, In recent months many
men and some women have been
lynched, burned and otherwise
killed without due process of law in
various states of the Union North
and South; and
Whereas, They were deprived of
the right of trial by jury guaranteed
to them by the Constitution of
the United States and the several
states of the Union and the good
order and peace and security of our
citizenship has been jeopardized by
these acts of heinous lawlessness and
murders; and
Whereas, Public sentiment is now
demanding the suppression of such
barbarous and inhuman practices
and our people are beginning to
punish the mobs which effect jail
deliveries and murder citizens accused
of crime;
Therefore be it resolved by the
City Council of the City of Chicago
that we deplore the unlawful killing
of our citizens to join in the sup
pression of lynch law and that we
command the governors of the various
states and all public officials and
all organizations who in recent
months have taken action for the
preservation of life and the sup
pression of murders by mobs.

their new Armory, 16th- and
Dearborn street, with a grand mill
tary ball. The grand march was led
by Col. Daniel Moriarty and Mrs. John
F. Ryan. It was an imposing affair to
behold. Well on to two thousand per
sons participated in it, every inch of
standing space was occupled by thou
sands who witnessed the grand affair,
It was owing to the untiring efforts of
Col. Moriarty and his gallant aids that
everything in connection with the

a well oiled or regulated clock smooth.
