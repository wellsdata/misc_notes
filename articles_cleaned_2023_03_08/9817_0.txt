I. L. D. BATTLES
LYNCHING WAVE
Sharp Statement on
Sherman Murder
The outrageous and fiendish murder
of George Hughes, Negro worker
, at Sherman, Texas, by a mob of
white ruling class bloodthirsty
lynchers, is clear evidence of the
means which the boss class and its
agents are utilizing in their attempt
to suppress the struggles of the
Negro masses.
This brutal lynching follows very
closely the lynching of Wilkins,
Dave Harris, Allen Green, Laura
Wood, Jimmie Levine and others
within the past few weeks.
General Campaign.
The International Labor Defense
points out that this bloody massacre
of Negro workers is part of the
whole vicious campaign of murdering
, legal. lynching and persecution
conducted by the plundering boss
class against the whole working
class. This is very clearly illus-
trated in the legal lynching process
against two militant white workers,
M. H. Powers and Joe Carr, in Atlanta
, Ga. IcPherson Anderson, a
Negro worker in Crescent Springs,
Kentucky, and the wholesale brutal
attacks upon the workers through
out the whole country.
The International Labor Defense
holds the government of Texas and
the Federal Government responsible
for the shedding of the blood of
Hughes. The governor of Texas
will readily send his troops to rain
bullets into the bodies of workers
striking for better conditions, but
for these same troops to protect the
life of a Negro worker from the
fiendish lynch gang, he gave the
order" hold them if you can, but
don't shoot anybody."
What Troops Are For.
This is the use of the government
of the ruling class, not to protect
the lives of the workers- Negro and
white but as an agent for murdering
and persecuting workers.
The International Labor Defense,
denounces in the most categorical
terms this barbarous lynching of
Hayes, and holds the government
responsible for this bloody crime in
the eyes of the toiling masses, Negro
and white. The I. L. D. calls
upon all Negro and white workers
to increase most energetically the
fight against lynching, to organize,
to unite, and to fierce
carry on a
against lynching and the
whole struggle lynch law system.
