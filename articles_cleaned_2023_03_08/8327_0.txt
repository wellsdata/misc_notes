The Writing Erased.
WHEELING, Nov. 1.- A dispatch received
by the Intelligencer says the specials sent out
from Milton, W. Va., in regard to the Hatfield
- McCoy trouble and battle said to have
taken place yesterday are totally false.
There has been no trouble since Thursday
night of last week, when McCoy and Haley
were lynched. The excitement is abating,
there is no necessity for the presence
and of troops.
