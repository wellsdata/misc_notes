JUSTICE BREWER ON APPEAL.
Some time ago Justice David J. Brewer of the supreme
court of the United States suggested the taking
away of the right of appeai as one means of checking the
lynching spirit. The suggestion provoked severe criti-
Icism to which Justice Brewer replies by an article in the
,
Independent, which is a severe indictment of our whole
Bystem of jurisprudence. The article directs public attention
to a state of the law which is the real seat of
the disease of which the lynching spirit is only the symp-
tom.
Justice Brewer cites a number of decisions of the
supreme court to show that the right of appeal is neither neither
is
a constitutional nor a natural right, but is simply a statutory
privilege which the state may give or take away
as public policy may dictate. He then goes on to show
that the right of appeal is systematically abused in this
country, both in civil and criminal cases, until it amounts
to a denial of justice. Such a state of affairs exhibits
lynch law as private justice called into being in default
of public justice. Justice Brewer asks:" Is it strange
that a community incensed by some atrocious offense,
aware of the common experience of criminal proceed
ings, takes the into its own hands and summarily
punishes the offender law?"
