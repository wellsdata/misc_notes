ОМАНА,
MAHA, Neb., Sept. 30.- The condition
of mayor Ed. P. Smith, who
was injured here Sunday during race
rioting when a mob attempted to
lynch him, was improving this morn
ing. The mayor is still at the hospital
to which he was taken follow-
ing the attempted lynching.
Military forces which have been on
the streets of the city
duty patroling
were augmented today by the arrival
of 511 men and 18 officers from Camp
Grant, Ill. About 300 more soldiers
arrived later in the day from Camp
Funston, Kans.
The city was quiet last night. No
disorders of any kind occurred. Regular
army soldiers and special police
patroled the city throughout the
night.
Twenty four negroes, dressed in
civilian clothes, wearing special
police badges and carrying arms,
appeared at Twentyfourth and
Cumings streets last night. They
said they had been sworn in as
special officers by a city official.
Seldiers took them to a fire sta
tion, took their weapons away
and released them.
A heavy rain served to keep per
sons off the streets. This fact was
considered a great aid to the authorities
, who had taken every possible
precaution to guard against a fresh
outbreak of Sunday's rioting, which
resulted in the death of two persons,
to many others, heavy damage
to injury the county courthouse, and an at-
commanding generals of mill
departments to furnish
tary
to
troops necessary for the pro
of
tection of lives and property in
of
case of disorders in the limits of
their departments. Such protection
can be furnished only on re
quest from the proper state officials
, the instructions from see
the
retary Baker said.
It was explained that the action
the was taken to obvinte the necessity
of departmental commanders
referring such requests to the department
with consequent danger
of the disorders getting out of
control before action could be
taken.
