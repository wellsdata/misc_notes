cence. No sentimental appeal can
be successfully made to twelve white
men in favor of a negro who may
reasonably be suspected of that offense
. Yet a negro whom a mob
sought to lynch and whom Governor
Cole Blease, when appealed to by
the faithful sheriff who stood off
the mob, failed to protect, has been
acquitted.
There is a warning in this case
for lynchers. If this South Carolina
mob had not been intimidated by
the brave sheriff, who, when the
inner door of the jail was reached,
gave warning" I'll kill the first man
who enters that door," an innocent
would have been Tynched.
