U
the hope is ex
pressed that lynching is on the decline in this

There is an apparent decline from which it would be
pleasant to argue the speedy disappearance of this
serious offense against law and civilization. There is
a lack of certainty of classification, however, that im
pairs the usefulness of the statistics. It is not known
whether all cases of mob violence are included or only
those instances in which mobs have taken culprits
from legal custody and inflicted the death penalty.
The statement is made that not all the illegal executions
in the South find their way into print. Suspicion
is followed by assassination of negroes in the
South with far greater frequency than secures the attention
of the newspapers. The infliction of personal
vengeance on that race, which may not be classified as
lynch law, is by no means uncommon, and yet it has
the same origin. A negro is suspected of pilfering or
inciting others to crime and is quietly removed,
no comment follows. and
Senator Morgan's speech in the Senate, in which
he asserts the rights of white civilization as superior
to the constitution and to be maintained by forcible
suppression of the negro wherever his numbers
threaten white supremacy, tells the whole story.
Where the principles of that speech prevail a negro
lives only because it does not occur to some one to
kill him. As soon as his thrift or his influence makes
him formidable to white civilization only own skill
at dodging or courage in fighting can save his his life.
If the statistics embraced all the cases of enforce
ment of the principles of the Senator's speech the
number of executions would probably be
found to be illegal upon the increase.
