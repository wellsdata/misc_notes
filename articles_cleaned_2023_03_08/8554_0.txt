He was kindly treated, but the Allens
found him, reclaimed him by force, and beat
him cruelly. Twice more he sought refuge
with Farmer Norton. The last time the
Allens strung him up to a tree by the neck
and left him hanging. He was cut down by
neighbors in time to save his life, and Allen,
says, is yet serving time for attempted
he murder.
