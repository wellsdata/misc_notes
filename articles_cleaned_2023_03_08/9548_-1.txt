I lived to reach Fort Leavenworth
again, and just in time to witness
Judge Lynch's little game. The boys
didn't use the drop like they do in the
East. They merely attached the noose
end of the rope to the victim and
launched him into eternity by throw
ing the rope over the stockade, and
the willing hands at the other end
backing off like a bay mare when it
sees a brass band for the first time.
After the victim is pronounced" done
fer" committee
, the on reception
throws in an accompaniment of about
thirty loads of buckshot without any
further charges. In those good old
days, being hung was the only luxury
uncharged for.
