HE MAY BE LYNCHED.
Murderer Brown Is on Trial for
His Life.
Special to the Globe.
MOORHEAD, Minn., Jan. 17.- The district
court finally succeeded to- day in
getting a jury to try Murderer Brown.
County Attorney Douglas opened the
case for the state in an hour's speech.
The prosecution placed two witnesses
on the stand, and their evidence shows
that Brown is guilty of murder in the
first degree. Brown testified that he
was under the influence of liquor when
the deed was committed; that he did
not intend to kill Paull; he thought it
was Benson, the Fargo policeman, he
fired at, and only did it so to frighten
him and evade arrest. Brown's attorney
, Mosness, has quite a reputation as
a criminal lawyer, and will try hard to
secure the acquittal of his client. The
case is attracting wide attention. It is
said that if the murderer is convicted
of anything less than murder in the first
degree an attempt will be made to lynch
him. Brown unconcerned
about his fate. appears
