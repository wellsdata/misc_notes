Almost a Lynching.
Special to the Globe.
NEW YORK, Aug. 14.- The lynch law
of the frontier came within an ace of
taking the life of an innocent man in
Jersey City to- day. A boy sitting on
the curbstone got a bullet in his back
and fell forward in the street screaming
with pain. Two men were shooting at
a target in the meadows near by and a
erowd at once pounced on them as responsible
for it. One of them was Seig
fried Schneider, of this city, a well to
do gunmaker. While a number of the
crowd held him others ran for a rope
and put it about his neck and dragged
him to a tree. His cries and protestations
of innocence were in vain. The
boy's wound he said was made by a pis
tof bullet and not a rifle bullet. The
croud refused to listen and gave
Schneider one minute to pray. At this
critical junction, John Schaeffer ran out
from a house near by and acknowledged
that the shot came from a pistol in his
house. Schaeffer and nine guests in his
house were put under arrest and
Schneider was taken home half dead
from fright. The boy will live.
Schaeffer cannot satisfactorily explain
why he fired the pistol or whether
shooting was accidental. the
