There was considerable feeling against
young Mitchell worked up last night,
which was nided by some alleged indiscreet
utterances of some officers. Whether
or not the officers really made the remarks
attributed to them is not known at this
hour of the morning, but it is known that
there were reports that there might be a
lynching. These were mere Idle reports,
however and no concerted efforts were
made in, this direction.
