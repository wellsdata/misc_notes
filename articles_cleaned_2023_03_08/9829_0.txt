was condemnatory of the act
of the lynchers, and many whose sentiments
had been against Frank in
life were outspoken in their regret
at the manner of his taking off. In
the streets there was heard condone-
ment of the lynching as well as condemnation
of the act. It was a
dreadful thing to happen, the reputation
of the state would suffer and
lawlessness was to be deplored- but
the thing was settled for good and
all and there was a distinct sense of
relief as if
burden had been removed

an
One of the first arrivals was a man
in a frenzy of passion. He was bare
headed, coatless, his eyes blazing like
those of a maniac. He pushed
through the crowd, ran up to the
body, threw up his hands and clench
ed his fists and shook them at the
body. Then his hands would open
and his fingers would writhe and his
fists would close again, and he would
shake them at the body.
" Now we've got you," he screamed.
" You won't murder any more little
innocent girls. We've got you now!
We've got you now!"
" They won't put a monument over
you," he cried." They are not going
to get you, they are not going to get a
piece of you as big as a cigar!"
The crowd yelled and pressed clos
er.
At this juncture a short, thick- set
man ran up, jostled his way through
the crowd and pushed to a place be
side the man who was cursing the
body. He climbed up on something so
that he could see over the heads of
the crowd.
Men, hear me," he said.
It" was Newt A. Morris, former judge
of the Blue Ridge circuit, who had
just arrived in an automobile from
Marletta with Attorney John Wood of
Canton. They were attending court,
heard the news early this morning
and came at top speed to the scene.
" Hear me, men," said Judge Morris.
The crowd grew quiet except for a
mumbling in an undertone by the man
beside the body.
" Citizens of Cobb county, listen to
me, will you?" said Judge Morris.
They gave a murmur of assent.
Whoever did this thing
"
"
The man beside the body broke in
with a shout:" God bless him, whoever
he was!"
Judge Morris laid his hand on the
man's shoulder and asked him please
to be quiet for a few minutes." Who
ever did this thing," said Judge Mor
ris," did a thorough job."
The crowd whooped.
" They shore did," chorused the
crowd.
" Whoever did this thing," said
Judge Morris," left nothing more for
us to do. Little Mary Phagan is vindicated
. The foul murder is avenged.
Now I ask you, I appeal to you as
citizens of Cobb county, in the name
of our county, not to do more.
appeal to you to let the undertaker
take it."
The man by the body broke in
again.
" We are not going to let the under-
taker have it," he shrieked." We are
not going to let them erect a monument
over that thing! We are not
going to let them ha a plece of it
as big as a cigar! We are going to
burn it! That's what we are going to
do! We are going to bur: it! Come
on boys! Let's burn the dirty thing!"
Judge Morris raised his voice.
" Men, I appeal to you!" he shouted.
" Don't do anything to this body. Let
the undertaker have it. This man
has a father and a mother, and
ever we think of him what-
ever we think of him, they are entitled
to have the body of their son. Men,
men! I appeal to you for the good
of our country. Let all who are for
giving this body over to the undertaker
say' aye.'"
There was chorus of" ayes."
" Now let all who oppose it say
' no," said Judge Morris.
The hand of the man beside the
body was raised aloft, trembling with
excitement.
Judge Morris got down and ran
back through the crowd and began to
call for
an undertaker. While he
was
calling somebody laid a knife on the
rope and Frank's body dropped to the
ground with a thud and the crowd
packed around it in a solid mass with
,
the excited man standing at the head
.
A negro ran up to Judge Morris.
" Here I am, judge," he said," and
here's my wagon."
Judge Morris gave orders and the
negro opened the back of the wagon
and pulled out a long undertaker's
basket and started with it toward the
body.
" Bring the body on, men!" shouted
Judge Morris bring

But none of them would pick it up
and Judge Morris, beckoning
to the
negroes, finally got hold of it and
started to the undertaker's wagon.
The man who voted" no" reached out
and struck at the body, and the negroes
dropped it and when it hit the
ground the man stamped upon the
face and ground his heels into the
dead flesh, and stamped again and
again until the crowd intervened
