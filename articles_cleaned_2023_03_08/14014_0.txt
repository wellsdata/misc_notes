MOB LYNCHES NEGRO.
Tennessee Citizens Are Angered by
Stay of Execution Granted by
Supreme Court.
Chattanooga, Tenn., March 21.- Ed
Johnson, colored, was taken from jail
by a mob of seventy- five men and
hanged to a beam of the county bridge
over the Tennessee river. The rope
broke and the negro's body fell and
the mob quickly riddled him with bul
lets. Sheriff Shipp and the jailer were
locked in a bathroom when the mob se
cured the prisoner. There was no dis
order.
The negro was to have been hanged
today, but the United States supreme
court yesterday granted a stay of execution
and this action angered the citizens
of the city.
Early in the evening the mob began
to form and it was all done so quietly
that only those in the immediate vicinity
of the jail knew when they were
ready for action. Seventy- five of the
better class of citizens assembled at
the jail and at once gained admission.
Overpowering the sheriff and his deputies
they secured the prisoner and
quietly led him to the bridge, where
the hanging was carried out in the
orderly manner, the mob immedi
most ately dispersing.
