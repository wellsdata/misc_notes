MURDERED FIVE OF HIS OWN RACE.
Negro, Crazy Drunk, Started to Kill
Every One He Met.
Meridian, Miss., June 14.- News has
been received here of the murder
of five negroes in the extreme north
western portion of Kemper county. A
negro man named Silbey, while crazy
drunk, secured a gun and started out
to kill every person he met. The first
he came across happened to be five negroes
, three women and two children,
and the fiend shot them down and left
them dead where they fell. He also
shot at six other negroes, who narrowly
escaped.
As soon as the bloody work of Sibley
was discovered the most intense excite
ment prevailed, and a mob was organized
to lynch the murderer. Sibley
took to the woods, carrying his shotgun
with him, and at last accounts the mob
had surrounded him and a bloody fight
imminent
was.
