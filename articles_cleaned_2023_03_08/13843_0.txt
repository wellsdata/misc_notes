It is not always a white mob that
lynches the colored offender and law
breaker. Recently in Bainbridge,
Ga., a mob of negroes lynched one of
their race who had criminally assault
ed a colored girl. The mob of colored
men took the accused from the sheriff
and strung him up to a tree and riddled
him with bullets. The indignation
of the blacks when one of their
own race is victimized is as strong as
that in the of their white
brothers under bosom similar circumstances.
