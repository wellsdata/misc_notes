ELECTS FORM OF DEATH
Chicagoan Is Forced to Chose Electrocution
to White Hot Metal.
Chicago, Sept. 5.- Nels Anderson, mo
tor inspector for the Illinois Steel com
bany, chose death by electrocution in
preference to a more horrible fate in
one of the company's seething metal
pits today at South Chicago.
Anderson was doing repair work on
the arm of a crane directly above the
hot metal pit. A slight movement of
his arm caused him to lose his balance.
The only support within reach was an
uninsulated live wire which connected
the crane with the power.
The doomed man gave one glance at
the white hot metal below and caught
the wire as he fell. He was almost instantly
killed. His body hung over
the wire until the current could
shut off. be
