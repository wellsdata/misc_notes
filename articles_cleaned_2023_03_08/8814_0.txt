A HORRIBLE MURDER.
Two Ladies Assaulted in Prince
George's County- One Killed and
the Other Terribly Beaten.
John Berry, a young negro, aged 19 years,
killed Miss Amanda Clark, near Bowie, in
Prince George's county, on Saturday night
last, and at the same time beat into insensibility
and attempted to outrage Miss Annie
Clark, a younger sister of the lady he killed.
SCENE OF THE MURDER.
The scene of the murder is about two and
a- half miles south of Bowie. The Misses
Clark lived alone on a farm on the road from
Bowie to White Marsh Church. Berry was
secured by Miss Amanda Clark about two
years ago from Cheltenham Reformatory
School for Colored Boys and was employed
to assist the two ladies about their house
work. No one can tell just at what hour the
young negro commenced the assault, but eir
cumstances and events place the hour at about
7 o'clock, on Saturday evening. While he
has confessed the crime, there are other evidences
to corroborate the story, which, in all
its details, stamp it as one of the most nota
ble in the criminal annals of Prince George's
county and its perpetrator to be one of the
coolest creatures in existence.
Berry was arrested and taken to jail at Up
per Marlboro, and later was removed to the
Baltimore City Jail to save him from lynch
ing which he richly merited. He confessed
to the killing both before and since his arrest,
and his story below is a true one as Miss An
nie Clark says except that the boy had not
been ill- treated, or scolded.
