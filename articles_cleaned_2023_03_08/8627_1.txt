Negroes Especially Attacked
When the Albany police attacked.
Amter recounted
, they singled out the Negro
workers for special attack. But the
Negro workers not only did not
buckle under, but courageously met
the cossack- attack of the police.
" One Negro woman worker, a hun-
ger marcher," Amter reported as the
crowd cheered thunderously," beat
up no less than eight cops after she
had been cursed at and mishandled."
Amter told how their experiences
with the forces of" law and order"
had caused 32 of the hunger marchers
to join the Communist Party.
In crisp biting manner Amter
,
,
exposed the hypocrisy of the Re-
publican gubernatorial candidate,
Mcses, in pretending sympathy for
the hunger marchers. He cited the
actions of Hoover in ordering the
military attack upon the bonus
marchers in Washington, and of
similar terroristic acts on the part
of Republican and Democratic poll-
tiens in every part of the county.
Paying his respects to the Social
ist Mayor of Bridgeport, Conn.,
Mayer McLevy, Amter told how this
Socialist executive had approved of
the slugging and arrest of anti
fascist demonstrators in that city
recently.
" Tunger, war and fascism," Amter
concluded," are the crucial issues
facing the workers at the present
moment. To vote for the Communist
Party is to strike hard at the capitalist
system and the misery which
it breeds."
His head bandaged, Carl Green
burg, one of the hunger marchers,
described the almost incredible
brutality of the Albany police
when the marchers scught to
enter the city last Tuesday. The
crowd booed as Greenberg told
how police pummeled him after
he had been clubbed into virtual
insensibility. Greenberg graphic
ally described the subsequent ar
rests of the hunger marchers, how
they were grilled in the Albany
police station, of the successful
fight of the I. L. D. to free them
and of their conference, where
they mapped their campaign for
immediate relief and Unemployment
Insurance.
Olgin Cites Freedom in U. S. S. R.
Moissaye J. Olgin, editor of the
" Morning Freheit" and candidate
for Congress in the 23rd Congressional
district, Bronx, describing his
recent visit to the Soviet Union, said
that the pictures of Russian work
ers being sabred by the Czar's cos
sacks which he saw in the Museum
of the Revolution in Moscow coincided
perfectly with the pictures of
boss terror against workers as revealed
in Albany recently." The pictures
of pogroms against Jews in
czarist Russia coincide with the
scenes of lynching of Negroes in the
South." When he looked at the pictures
of czarist oppression, Olgin
said, he felt like," U. S. A.,
I recognize you." saying
