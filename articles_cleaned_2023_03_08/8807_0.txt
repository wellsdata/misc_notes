the common council. Nine Socialist
supervisors are conceded and one
more is possible out of 20 in the
county board.
BIG VALE GAINS
Hoan's
vote in 1920 was 40,530.
His 1924 vote is an increase of 50
per cent. He has
been mayor continuously
for eight years and before
that was Socialist
attorney
Rose, who was declared
.
bankrupt in
the courts in 1915 has flirted
with mining companies and unsuccessful
law practice, attempted to
make a campaign on Hoan's lack of
sympathy for the war and Hoanâ€™s
refusal to bend the knee to the king
of Belgium when that monarch went
on a begging tour of this country.
Rose's first bow to Milwaukee
was
with an armed force to break the
steel strike of 1886.
THRIVES UNDER SOCIALISM
Charges by Rose that Socialist
rule was driving business cut of the
city and state fell flat in the face of
official figures. The Socialists, it
was also made clear, have not had
control of the city council for a
dozen years. While they are the
second party in the Wisconsin legis-
lature with the Democrats nowhere
they are not strong enough at Madison
to control state legislation.
Latest returns give Hoan 74,000
and Rose 56,000, giving Hoan a majority
of 18,000.
SHERIFFS PREVENT
LYNCHING OF NEGRO
Mob violence would
decrease if
public officials followed the example
of the Rocky Mount, Va., officers who
prevented the lynching of Ote Gil-
bert, a negro sentenced to 20 years
for criminal assault
, the American
Civil Liberties Union declares in a
statement issued today.
According to a letter received by
the Union from J. P. Lee, public
prosecutor of Rocky Mount, a mob
formed outside the jail to lynch Gilbert
, but dispersed when they found
that any attempt to take the prisoner
would result in a number of
people being killed.
" The officers were determined to
go to any length in the protection of
the prisoner, even to the sacrifice of
their lives," Lee's letter to the Civil
Liberties Union declares." The result
of the whole matter was satisfactory
. The negro was saved from
lynching and nobody was hurt."
