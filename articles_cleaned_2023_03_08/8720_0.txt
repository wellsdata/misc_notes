John Mills, the Mormon Preacher.

* HIS FIGHT WITH COL. TURK.
When the Mormons settled in Missouri
an enthusiastic young
ed Mills was their most popular and admired
preacher. Indeed so great was his
fame that whenever he held meetings a
crowd of the saints were sure to be present
. wie
on A strong and violent mob of lynchers
was about this time organized to put down
the Mormons, under the command of Col.
Turk- one of the most desperately dangerous
men that Missouri, or in truth, any
other country ever produced. Some of
the Mormons were tarred and feathered,
some were scourged with long, knotty
hickories, till they tainted from the excess
of torture and the loss of blood- others
were forcibly deprived of their property.
and reduced in a day to the condition of
beggars -- while others still shared a doom
of more mercy and were shot down on the
prairie like so many wolves. At last
Turk resolved to take some of the conceit
out of the young preacher, Mills, and
he gave notice to his men accordingly.ed
It was a dreadfully cold night in midwinter
, 1883, and although the sky was
cloudless, and the full moon shone out in
all her splendor. the earth lay in that pear-
Iv radiance. chill and dreary as a frozen
tomb; for a thick sheet of snow crusted its
surface, and the north wind howled over it
a dismal dirge. It was a night to drive
even thieves and outlaws into barns and
stables for shelter, and to keep honest
people by the blaze of their own roaring
hearths.
And yet strange to say, in a large log-
cabin, within three hundred yards of the
Missouri River, then frozen from shore to
shore, at least one hundred people na assembled
to hold a religious meeting. They
were Mormons, you may be sure. No fanatic
of an old faith would have turned
out on such a night; they must be fresh
zealots, with some new idea but at its birth
in their hearts, and flaming like a meteor
in their imaginations, or they never could
have ventured to face such an ice blast as
that. The congregation included mened
and women in about equal numbers, and
many of the former carried rifles, which
they grasped with one hand, even when
kneeling down in prayer; such was the imminence
of peril either real or imagined
,
,
as they deemed pending over them.
The preacher- the enthusiast, Mills
had advanced to a thrilling head of his
eloquent discourse, and was painting in
terrible free- language the bitter persecution
which has ever followed the footsteps of
all great reformers since the beginning of
SO
animated or half so affecting. His blue
eye gleamed like a star- his voice pealed
like a trumpet, shrill as the wind which
whistled over the house top; and his beard-
less lip literally with music
. Groans, tears, and wild shrieks from
the audience, proved the despotic power
of his utterance.
Suddenly, three rifles exploded in
succession before the door, and three quick sen-

tinels, shaking with terror, rushed into the
room, crying out." The mob! the mob!
save yourselves from Colonel Turk's mob!"
No scene of dis

may and confusion the seen the fe
males screamed aloud, as if all hope had
departed Several of the men sprang out
of the windows and fled, as if pursued by
a legion of devils, while most of those
who remained appeared stupified and to
tally powerless, either to escape or make
ready for resistance. Indeed there was
little space allowed for preparation. In a
few minutus a mob amounting to hundreds
had surrounded the building, and the muzzles
of fifty cocked guns and pistols were
thrust in through the doors and windows.
Still none within lifted a finger for defence;
fear seemed to have turned them into stone.
Persecution had not yet hardened the
" Latter Day Saints" into veterans, and
the afterwards famous" Mormon Legion"
existed then only in the imagination of the
prophet.
Presently the lynchers, headed by the
all- dreaded and gigantic Colonel Turk,
rushed in, and began to beat the people
furiously with the iron ramrods of their
rifles, with very little distinction of mercy
as to the age or sex. The cries and vain
entreaties of the poor sufferers swelled to
a wail wilder than the bowling of the wind
without. At length Colonel Turk roar

And the drunken mob shouted, and hastened
to execute the brutal mandate.
Up to this time young Mills had con
bibtinued standing with the Bible of their
prophet in his hand, but unearthly pale
and strangely excited, his lip writhing. his
teeth clenched, and his bright eyes swim
ming in a halo of fire. Suddenly he made
a bound for an adjacent window, and not
withstanding more than twenty endeavor
ed to seize him, he effected his escape
from the house.
" Chase him -- shoot him- take him,
alive or dead!" cried Turk, in a transport
of rage, setting the example by commencing
the pursuit himself.
The flight of Mills was directed in a
straight line for the river, and his marvellous
agility, added to the start he had first
got, soon placed him at some distance
ahead. They fired both rifles and shotat

on a pair of skates, which he had carried
in his pocket for the last few days to
be ready for any extraordinary emergency;
and then taking the ice, skinued over the
frozen stream with the swiftness of the
wind.ww
Has nobody a pair of skates?" shouted
Col. Turk, striking his forehead with a
gesture of wrath and vexation.
" I have," answered one of the mob;
" but I shall certainly not try them on the
ice such a night as this." d
" Be quick, give them to me!" exclaimed
Turk, in a tone of fiery impatience.
The skates were produced; the eager
Colonel tried them on; and then, swearing
a dreadful oath that he would bring back
the preacher's scalp or leave his own, he
began the perilous chase. Oh! there is no
daring like the courage inspired by the
passion for revenge!
In the meanwhile, Mills had approach
the farther shore, when he discovered
the startling apparition of armed men on
the bank. He knew at a glance what it
meant. The mob. to prevent any of the
Moroas from escaping, had stationed a
guard beyond the river. He instantly
turned his course down the stream, when
a whole platoon let off their rifles, but the
distance was too considerable. A hail
of bullets rattled around him on the ice
without injury.
" I will foil the fiends yet," he said to
himself, and put forth all his speed. Mills
flew away, when he became conscious that
some one was pursuing him. He slackened
his velocity, and gradually wheeled
about to obtain a view of his enemy. But
the latter was still too remote for an accurate
survey, and the Mormon uttered
aloud a mad prayer --" God grant me that
it be Col. Turk, and I am willing to die!"
On rushed the pursuer -- on, still on. like
an avalanche. The noise of his iron
skates coul I be heard above the roar of
the northern blest and his dark form loom
in the glittering moonbeams, large in
statue as a giant. As he drew nearer,
the young preacher smiled venomously
the recognized the arch- persecutor, Col.
Turk, and he laughed outright, a laugh
that rung over the frozen river like the wild
scoff of some demon, when he saw the
other unsheath his gleaming knife. Mills
then immediately pulled his own from its
scabbard, and started off, so as to avoid
the coming shock, which might otherwise
prove fatal, by the mere force of
the collision, to both.

most terrible ever conceived. They marked
the smooth surface of the ice with circles

almost every possible figure of plain geometry

and could not find the other at fault, or
take him unprepared. They passed
peatedly within three feet of each other re,

the bone! And still the cloud grew more
intense, and the wrathful wind howled on,
while their manoeuvres and flights somehow
carried them farther down the river,
where the cruste ice was thinner, and
cracked fearfully beneath their tread.
Finally the Mormon took the desperate
resolve to terminate the strife by sacrificing
his own life so as to make sure of that of
his foe at the same time In the following
rush, he no longer turned aside to avoid a
direct collision, and frustrated the attempt
of the lyncher to that end by swerving
slightly inwards from a right line. bid
They met at full speed, and the shock
was like that of the crush of adverse com

ice split beneath their weight, with a
deafening roar, and the wild waters, boiling
and hissing like a hell, swallowed them
forever- the persecutor and his victim,
both victims now!
But the river still rolled on its way to
the sea; the stars all shone as bright and
beautiful as of old in the morning of creation
, when the angels of God chaunted
their birth song; and the wrathful wind of
winter howled on over the icy grave of
enemies no more! -Sunday Times. the
