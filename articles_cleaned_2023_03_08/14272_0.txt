CRIME HIS OF PENALTY
NEGRO MURDERER PAYS
Houston, Miss., February 9.- Roby Bas
kin, murderer of the Rev. W. T. Hud
son, was lynched by a mob here this aft
ernoon. A crowd of over 300 determined
citizens took the negro from jail and
hanged him to a nearby tree. Not a shot
was fired and the whole proceeding was
conducted in a quiet but business- like
fashion. Sheriff Bean of Okolona arrived
just as the negro breathed his last.
The prisoner was secured without resistance
and accepted his fate as a matter
of course, sullen and without a word of
entreaty or prayer. He was hanged from
an elm tree within 200 yards of the coun
ty jail. Yesterday the same mob gathered
about the jail, intent on inflicting sum
mary punishment. At the entreaty of the
local county officials, who urged that ef
forts made to secure a speedy trial

and the law be allowed to take its course,
declaring that if such were possible they
would protect the negro with their lives,
action was deferred, and a messenger
sent to Booneville, where Judge A. O.
Sykes is holding court, with a request for
a special term. This Judge Sykes declined
to call, and today the same mob,
reformed, went to the jail, where the ne
gro was surrendered and the lynching
was soon accomplished.
The representatives of the sheriff here
declare that they consider their action
in surrendering the negro, in view of the
refusal of the court to call a special term,
justified in the interest of law and order.
Should their action be criticised they de
clare they will resign. According to Bas
kin's confession he first robbed, and, in
fear that he would be arrested for the
robbery, shot and killed the minister,
throwing his body into a pond, where it
was by searchers.
