tacked a young woman.
The grand jury composed of a group
representative white citizens issued
of a statement which read:
" In the lynching of Lloyd Warner
we wish to state that our act should
not be taken as final in closing the
investigation of this inhuman orgy,
but we feel that only a beginning has
been made which should be pursued
further by the law enforcement agencies
of the state and county, and
wherever the facts would justify other
arrests and prosecutions than those
already in progress, we earnestly sug
gest that guilty parties speedily
brought to justice." be
