An Atrocious Case of Bape
, 7 May, DUQUOIN III, 1967..
Special Correspondence of the Chicago Tribune.]
On Friday last a fiend, named John Mobley
, committed a rape upon a little girl
named Webber, the daughter of one of our
most respectable citizens. The child is but
nine years old, and very small of her age.
She informed her parents of the outrago,
when steps were taken to arrest Mobley,
fled. who
All traces of the wretch were lost until
yesterday, when he was recognized in Ben
ton, Franklin County, twenty miles from this
place. He resisted all attempts to arrest
him for some time, using a knife and club
most furiously, but was finally overpowered
and committed to jail in default of$
bail. 1 3,000
Mobley is a man of some property, nearly
sixty years of age, and has a most exemplary
wife and family, but is a hard subject him
self, having onco before been indicted for a
like offence, as well us several other Stato
Prison crimes. The community is highly
excited against the accused, and it would
have required encouragement to have
had lynch law little enforced at once.
