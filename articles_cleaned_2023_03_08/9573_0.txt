A mob of three hundred negroes
attempted to lynch a negro murder
er in Missouri last week, but was
quickly suppressed by the sheriff.
Such unwarranted attempts to usurp
the privileges of the southern gentlemen
will not be tolerated, and it
remarkable restraint that the
showed entire mob was not lynched.
