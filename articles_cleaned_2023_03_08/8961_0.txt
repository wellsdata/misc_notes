costing$ 350,000 and the Arcade,

Everything was quiet today, al.
though a large number of people were
on the streets, many coming here
from other cities to visit the ruins and
the place where the negro was lynch-
ed.
In a big mass meeting at the Y. M.
C. A. building and in the various
churches today and tonight a power
ful arraignment of the courts, in city,
state and nation was made by the
leading men of Springfield, in discuss
ing" who's to blame" for the mob
violence during the previous week.
Judge F. M. Hagan, who is recognized
as the most gifted public speaker
in this section of Ohio, took occasion
in his address at the mass meet-
ing to place the blame where he said
it belonged.
" Our city," he said," has just passed
through a crisis. Human life has been
taken by a mob. It has destroyed
private property with the torch. The
crisis has passed and we can now sur
vey the field, consider the causes and
plan for the future.
worse things might have been
done by the mob in Springfield. The
life of a miscreant was taken who de
served to die to the hands of the law.
Dens of infamy were destroyed which
the authorities should have suppressin
ed long ago. There has been no labor
riot, no bread riot, no mob has at
tacked the property of any man for
its own gain.
Mob law has ceased
and must not occur again.
" As to the causes- we open the
gates of our country to a flow of im
migrants, many of whom are of the
most ignorant, vicious and debased
people on earth, coming by the mil
lions to poison our society and to
seize the heritage which should be
preserved by our own people or to fill
our almshouses, jails, hospitals and
penitentiaries. The
time has come
to shut the gates of the land against
the ignorant and the vicious of other
lands. Our system of municipal government
is wrong.
A city governed
by politicians is without an excuse.
The spectacle is thus presented of
Christian men and sound business
men driven by the party lash to support
for high public positions
men
whom they would not employ for a
moment to conduct their own private
affairs. The men elected are pledged
to tolerate violations of law, so that
they may hope for a re- election.
" The grand jury should be abolished
. The public prosecutor ought to
be charged with presenting an indict-
ment against criminals without
any
grand jury. If this had been done, the
wretch who murdered Collis one week
ago today, might have been brought
to trial immediately.
The people
justly complain of too much delay
criminal trials." in
