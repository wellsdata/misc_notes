NEGRO LYNCHING
SUGGESTED THEME
SERMON AT TRINITY CHURCH.
REV. A. M. WILLIAMS' OBSERVATIONS
ON SPIRIT OF MOB LAW.
Miserable Victims Suffered Briefly,
While Marks Will Remain for
Life With Those Who Participated
- Geologically Speaking,
Present Time Will Be Known to
History as" The Lynch Era" -Evils
of Placing Transient Public Feel
ing Higher Than the Law.
" The Lynch Era" was the theme of
Rev. Dr. A. M. Williams at Trinity
Methodist Church last night. The
subject was suggested by the recent
events at Statesboro. A large congregation
heard Dr. Williams.
He chose for his text Luke 23:31:
" For if they do these things in a green
tree, what shall they do in a dry?"
Dr. Williams said in part:
" The text is a graphic aphorism- a
sententious putting a principle in figurative
form. Reduced to direct language
the proposition is: Iniquity
among the favored classes will reproduce
itself in revolting wickedness
among the less fortunates. It sug
gests a study of the sad events of last
week in relation to broader current
tendencies.
" The crime of the negroes is so
blood- curdling that it should not
dwell in the mind any longer than full
sympathy for the friends of the victims
and adequate legal punishment of the
perpetrators demand.
" The tragic end of the trial deserves
a few clear words. Every man in his
place is under obligation to support
organized society, constituted author
ity and legal process. Every good citizen
, therefore, must deplore the terri
ble occurrence. All the arguments
against lynching are illustrated in this
affair. The fair name of the section
and state is stained. The confidence in
the efficiency in government is shock
ed. Faith in the good judgment and
self- control of the common people is
weakened The effect on the participants
is lamentable..
