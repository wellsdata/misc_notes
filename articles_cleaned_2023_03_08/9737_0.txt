Failed to Identify.
Belleville, Ill., June 9.- At the in
quest yesterday over the remains of
Dave Wyatt, the negro lynched here
Saturday night, no testimony which
would tend to anyone in the
lynching could be elicited from the ten
witnesses examined. The coroner's
jury declined to wait for the arrival of
all witnesses, and after hearing ten
men, including Mayor Kern, a verdict
that Wyatt met his death at the
of parties unknown was returned hands.
