Picture of Lynching
HIGHLIGHTS from Latest Books.
CALDWELL PAINTS Vivid Picture
Sheriff Jeff McCurtain was in
trouble. Usually when a lynching
party got underway in Julie Coun
ty, Georgia, Sheriff McCurtain went
fishing. But this time he couldn't
get away fast enough.
Erskine Caldwell, of" Tobacco
Road" fame, tells the story of the
lynching and Sheriff Jeff's efforts
to avoid being caught in the middle
, politically, in the new novel,
" Trouble in July"( Duell, Sloan and
pearce:$ 2.50). Sometimes humor
ous, sometimes tender, always powerful
, Caldwell makes his characters
effectively real in this simple drama
of life and death in the Georgia
backwoods.
When Sheriff Jeff heard that a
mob was looking for Sonny Clark,
the sheriff started packing his
·
fishing tackle. He hated fishing,
hated mosquitoes, but he was safer,
politically, out of reach of a tele
phone until the affair was over. But
the planatation owner Sonny work
ed for demanded protection. Mrs.
Narcissa Calhoun, a fanatic, deter
mined to send all the Negroes back
to Africa, had identified Sonny, had
him.
heard Katy Barlow accuse
And Katy's father, Shep Barlow,
was as mean a tenant as ever lazied
through a crop. Judge Allen, the
political boss, wasn't much help,
either.
Sheriff Jeff might have gone fish
ing anway if a mob hadn't stormed
the jail and taken old Sam with
them. Sam never did anyone any
harm. He just liked to buy junk
cars and sell them. But he invariably
forgot that the cars were
mortgaged. So the sheriff would
keep Sam in ffail for a few days
to teach him a lesson Sam could
never learn.
It was to have Sam, not Sonny,
that the sheriff started trailing the
mob.
Caldwell paints a vivid picture
of the brutality of the phites, out
to lynch, and the terror of the
Negroes, huddled in their cabins. He
follows the innocent Sonny in his
losing, race with inevitable fate
trials Katy Barlow through her
brief moment of glory as Sonny's
accuser to her final remorse and
confession" He didn't do it!" to the
lynchers.
There si no place in American for
lynch law, but there is lots of room
for more books like Cladwell's
" Trouble in July."
