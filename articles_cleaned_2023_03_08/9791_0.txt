HIGHWAYMAN SHOOTS
HEAD OFF MAN'S BODY
MERCHANT OF FORLORN, MISS.,
SLAIN AND ROBBED BY
NEGRO.
Canton, Miss., Oct. 3.- Mannie Fields
a negro, escaped probable lynching
Sunday only through the watchfulness
of the authorities of Madison county
and the advice of cool- headed citizens
, as a result of the murder of
William J. Jordan, merchant, of For
lorn. Mr. Jordan was shot to death
Saturday night in a cotton field near
the point where the Yazoo and Mississippi
Valley railroad crosses the Big
Black river. His body was found by
searchers Sunday morning.
The nature of the murder aroused
public feeling in the vicinity to a high
pitch, and for a time it was feared
that violence would result from the
gathering of several hundred planters
and citizens of the Flora and Forlorn
districts, who participated in the
search for the slayer.
The assassin used a shotgun to kill
his victim. Several shots were fired
into the body and the head was practically
torn away by the charges. The
body was otherwise mutilated. Robbery
was the motive of the crime, as
the pockets of Mr. Jordan's clothing
had been cut out and their contents
removed.
Bloodhounds taken to the scene fol
lowed a trail to the home of Fields.
A short distance from the house, one
of the discarded pockets was found.
The dogs led the searchers to a bed
occupied by Fields, who was placed under
arrest. The man accused of the
crime remains sullen and refuses to
discuss the killing or his connection,
if any, with the case. A speedy trial
has been with the intention
of quieting promised the feeling in the section.
