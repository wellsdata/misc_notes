the white slave- drivers.
When the Southern ruling- class lynchers were mobilizing
all their forces to carry through the vicious lynch
verdicts against the nine innocent Scottsboro boys, the
Pittsburgh Courier was found on the side of the lynchers.
It d'rected its fire not against the Alabama ruling
class seeking to burn the boys in the electric chair, but
against the mass defense movement and its leader, the
Communist Party. It directly justified the lynch- action
against the boys with the provocative declaration:
" It is more likely, however, that if mobs break out
in Alabama and these eight boys are taken from the jail
and lynched it would probably be due to the nonsensical
activities of the Communists, who, by their misguided
energies, are finally driving the citizens of Alabama to the
point of desperation."
The poor lynchers whose aim is not to lynch the boys,
-Oh, no! -but whose intentions were noble and humane
are being driven to" desperation" by the vicious Communists
!
The Pittsburgh Courier is persistent in the defense
its white ruling- class masters. What was the attitude of

masses in the South is not an integral part of the whole
system of national oppression and its inevitable sharpen

What is the essence of this hypocritical swindle of the
Negro reformists and social- fascists? It is that the capitalists
are to maintain their wholesale violence against the
Negro masses without the resistance of these masses. Not
against the increasing, daily violence or the Bourbon dictatorship
, but against the resistance of the masses to this
violence: this, is the core of Negro reformism in the pre
sent period of rising class and Negro liberation struggles
This it has in common with social- fascism..
of the Pittsburgh Courier during the bloody events of December
19, in Tallapoosa County, Alabama? When the
Alabama landlords and their sheriffs, aided by their" Un
cle Toms," the Negro lackeys of Tuskegee Institute, were
trying to smash the growing struggles of the Negro share
croppers and exploited farmers against starvation and
oppression, when the press was doing everything in its
power to incite lynch violence against the Negro toilers,
the Courier again intervened on the side of" lynch law
and order." cairied a headline reading:" Tuskegee
Must Fight Reds It."
The Daily Worker has to depend upon not the rich,
but the poor to support it. Not the capitalists and the
landlords who incite lynching and frame up innocent Ne
gro boys in order to perpetuate a system of slavery- but
the slaves themselves are depended upon to support
