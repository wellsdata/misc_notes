SANTA ROSA, Cal., Dec. 10.
When members of the black
masked mob reached Healds
burg, 14 miles north of kere,
after lynching George Boyd, Ter
ence Pitt and Charles Valente,
they were given a public ovation,
according to word brought back
by a Santa Rosa newspaper man.
The streets of the big country
town, usually quiet as the heart
of a forest at that early morning
hour, rang with acclaim to the
lynchers, who parkedeir cars
around the city park and then
added their horns to the din.
One attractive young woman,
running up to a black- masked
figure, throwing her arms
arcund him cried," I am prouder
of you than if you had gone to
France and killed a hundred Ger
mans."
The din kept up for an hour or
mcre as though it were the
climax to some carnival time, the
reporter said.
EYE FOR EYE
AND TOOTH FOR TOOTH
SANTA ROSA, Dec, 10. -- The old
testament vengeance of" a life for a
life" was exacted of George Boyd,
Terence Fitts and Charles Valente by
a mob here today of between 50 and
100 men. All armed and masked in
black, they entered the Sonoma coun
ty jail at 12:30 this morning, over
powered Sheriff John Boyes and his
deputies and took the three men to a
cemetry and hangd them on the same
limb of an oak tree.
Had the three lived they would
have faced in court today a charge
of murdering Sheriff John A. Petray
of Sonoma county and Detectives
Miles H. Jackson and Lester H. Dor
man of San Francisco. The officers
were shot down by Boyd, he confess
ed, when they attempted to arrest the
three last Sunday as members of a
San Francisco gang which recently
attacked a score or more of young
women.
There was no confusion, no hurry,
no opposition to the mob. All had
been prearranged, even to the acety
line torches to burn off the jail locks
if necessary. Fifteen or more auto-
mobiles, with license plates removed,
advanced on the jail Guards turned
back the few passersby. The sheriff
and four deputies and two visltors
were covered by pistols; the keys
were taken and the men were rushed
to machines which moved quietly to
the cemetery.
There three nooses were hung over
a limb prviously selected. Regulation
hangman's knots were used, three
automobiles were drawn up to flash
their lights on the trees, and a cor
don of guards was placed about.
Boyd went quietly. Valente expos
tulated but made no resistance. Fitts
fought and was told to" take your
medicine" and then gagged with a
towel.
The three were then hanged in
their underclothing, which they wore
when taken from their cells.
Less than half an hour was requir-
ed to take men and complete the
work. the
