A startling analytical study on
the conditions in the South to
day made by a Southerner is
,
presented in Southern Expos-
"
" Ken-
ure, written by Stetson
nedy.
Some of the general information
contained in the book is no
news to many of us who have
either visited or lived in the
south. However, it may prove
revealing to those readers whose
impressions of the South have
been from romantic novels or
Hollywood sets of moonlight and
magnolias. Not only does Mr.
Kennedy rip the mask of tradition
from the face of the South,
exposing all of its ugliness,
crudeness and brutality in maintaining
a system of white supremacy
, but also he indicts its
Northern neighbors, the big industrialists
, whose money and
system of exploitation help to
keep hate sheets and organizations
operating.
The author has factual evi
Idence, in the form of documents
, reports and direct testimony
to back up his expose.
The inequality of the educa-'
tional system, the denial of the
ballot to many Negroes. the
attempts to keep Negroes in
the of
peonage occurrance
.
lynchings, the fight against the
inroads that the trade unions
are making to organize south
ern labor are all revealed in
" Southern Exposure."
This powerful book dares to
call a spade a spade when it
names individuals and publications
who are helping to keep
the South anslaved in an economic
and political web of race
hate.
Most dynamic portion of the
