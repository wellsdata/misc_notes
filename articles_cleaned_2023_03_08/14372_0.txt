to Prevent the Lynching.
Princess Anne, Md., June 10.- Will
iam Andrews, the young negro accused
"
of felonious assault upon Mrs. Benjamin
T. Kelley, was taken from the
gheriff here yesterday and beaten into
insensibility, and then hanged to a
tree, by an infuriated mob, immediately
after having been arraigned in court
.
and sentenced to death for his crime.
Andrews, who was but 20 years old,
came here from North Carolina, and
on May 5 of this year was arrested for
assault on Mrs. Kelley. At the time a
mob endeavored to lynch him, but he
was hurriedly taken to Baltimore, and
confined in the jail in that city until
Tuesday night, when he was brought
I
here for trial. During the night a
number of men assembled and care
fully planned yesterday's program.
Shortly before noon Andrews was
,
taken from the jail to the courthouse
,
and arraigned before Judge Page to
plead. He was thoroughly frightened,
and in a trembling voice pleaded
guilty. Judge Paige then sentenced
him to be hanged, and Sheriff Nelson,
together with Deputy Sheriff Dryden,
started to remove the prisoner to the
is jail. Just as they reached the outer
door someone shouted," Come on, boys;
I let's take the nigger," and a rush
was made for the sheriff and his deputy
. Blow after blow with clubs, bludgeons
and pistol butts were rained
upon the head of the prisoner, in spite
of the efforts of the officers to shield
him.
I Judge Page ran out of the courtroom
and implored the crowd to wait and let
justice take its course, but he might
as well have talked to the wind. The
sheriff and his deputy were soon over
powered, and then the maddened crowd
pounced upon the negro, threw him to
the ground and kicked him into complete
insensibility. Meanwhile a rope
had been procured, and picking up the
inanimate figure from the ground the
infuriated mob placed the rope around
the neck of the dying man, and drag
ging the body to a tree within a hundred
yards of the courthouse door
threw the rope over a limb and swung
the body into the air. Then a dozen
bullets were fired into the body, and it
was left dangling until the coroner ordered
it cut down. No attempt at dis
guise was made by any of who
participated in the lynching. those
