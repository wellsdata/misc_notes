Wreaked Vengeance
Not Believed Authorities Will Take
Action Although Many of the Mob
are known.
Wilmington, Del., June 24.- The
question here today is whether the
authorities will take action looking
toward the arrest and punishment
of those who were prominent in the
lynching of George White, the negro
who assaulted and killed Miss Helen
Bishop. That many of them are
known cannot be doubted, for they
were seen by the thousands who witnessed
the affair. It is also known
that the arrangements for the lynch
ing were the talk of the town and
that men were invited to take a hand
and were given notice of when and
where to assemble. It is a fact that
public sentiment so generally approves
the lynching that it would be
hard to secure the conviction of a
lyncher even if an arrest should be
made, which seems doubtful.
White's confession, made just be
fore the torch was applied to the pile
of oil- soaked bushes around him, was
an admission of everything, and
more than had been charged against
him. He is reported to have said:
" I was sent by Mr. Woodward

A Wilmington Preacher Declared
From tht Pulpit That Lynching
Would be Justified.
Wilmington, Del., June 22.- It has
been known all day in this city that
the negro George White would be
lynched tonight. Yesterday Rev.
Robert A. Elwood, of Olivet Presbyterian
church, told his congregation
that lynching would be justified,
though the father of Miss Bishop is
sued an appeal that the law be allowed
to take its course.
The State and county authorities
took no action. The Wilmington
militia was not ordered out, though
it could have reached the scene after
the mob began to assemble in time
to have saved the negro. Police reinforcements
were not sent to
prison until after the mob assembled the.

Third Attempt to Secure Prisoner
Proves Successful- Taken to the
Scene of His Crime, Fastened to a
Stake and Burned- As the Victim
Was Being Roasted His Body Was
Riddled With Bullets.
WILMINGTON, Del., June 22.- A
mob of three thousand persons to
night broke into the County Work-
house at New Castle, bent on lynch-
ing George White, the negro who
was held on the charge of assaulting
and then killing Miss Helen Bishop,
aged 17 years, last Monday.
The guards defended the place but
were overpowered. The negro was
taken from the work house by the
mob, who started with him for Price'sings
corner, the scene of the assault and
cut all wires leading
to Wilmington, which is five miles
from the work house.
The lynchers announced when they
had of the that

Price's corner. The negro was taken
to the scene of the crime. He there
confessed to having assaulted the

stake and his body riddled with bul
lets.
The crime for which White was
lynched was one of the most revolt
ing in the criminal annals of Dela
ware. The victim, Miss Helen S.
Bishop, daughter of the Rev. E. A.
Bishop. D. D., superintendent of the
Ferris Industrial School, would have
been 18 years old next October. She
was a student of the Wilmington
High School, and was on her way
home from the school last Monday,
when she was attacked. The industrial
school which is four miles from
,
here, where her parents made their
home is about three quarters of a
mile from Price's corner, where the
girl usually left the trolley car when
she came from school. Late Monday
afternoon a farmer working in the
field saw a young woman stagger
and fall in the road. She got up and
fell again and then she tried to crawl.
The farmer and his sons went to her
assistance, but when they reached
the girl she was lying unconscious in
the road. They found her to be Miss
Bishop. She had three ugly gashes
in her throat her body was badly
scratched and her clothing was torn
in many places. In one hand she
clutched a small pen knife which she
used at school in sharpening pencils.
There was every evidence that Miss
Bishop had made a desperate resist
ance in defense of her honor and her
life The wounded girl was taken
home and died the next afternoon
without regaining consciousness.
The entire neighborhood was al
most instantly aroused, and a man
hunt was immediately instituted.
Suspicion was fastenel on George F.
White, a negro just out of the work
house, and who was engaged as a la
borer on the farm of Edward Wood
ward, near the scene of the assault.
White was found in bed that same
night and when taken denied all
knowledge of the crime. He was
identified by several persons, who
said they saw him in the vicinity.
A knife which Mr. Woodward said
belonged to him was found where the
girl was assaulted. The negro was
brought to Wilmington but was
later transferred to the work house,
where the police he would be
safe from mob violence thought.
saw Mr. Woodward's daughter and I
intended to assault her but a couple
of men came along in a wagon and I
did not disturb her. Then I saw the
Bishop girl and I followed her. I
seized her and asked her if she had
any money she would give me to let
her go. She gave me sixty cents.
Then I again seized her and she cried:
Please don't hurt me.'
" I choked her and accomplished
my purpose. Then I asked if she
was going to tell on me. She said
she was. I gave her a hack in the
throat with my knife and asked again
if she was going to on me.
She said she was, and then inform I cut her
throat twice again and left her."
The negro's confession rendered
the already incensed crowd even
more desperate, and some wanted to
tear him limb from limb before they
reached the scene of his execution
The negro begged piteously not to
be burned, but no mercy was shown
the culprit, and, although his suffer
were terrible, White remained
conscious and rational for some time
after the torch was applied.
During today thousands of persons
went to the scene of the lynching,
many of them intent securing
upon
ghastly relics. In this, however,
they met with little success, as the
burning had been so effectual as to
destroy almost every vestige of the
victim's body The only remains
were pieces of his. bones.
