Noose Around Sheriff's Neck.
A rope was torn from a street car
trolley and a noose was placed
around Eley's neck. He was told he
would be hanged if he did not tell
where his prisoner was, and the mob
tore his clothing from his body and
kicked and beat him. Chief of Po
lice McKinney was helpless and at
tempted to deputize citizens to aid
him in rescuing the sheriff, but the
men refused to oppose the mob. Eley
finally surrendered to escape death,
and the mob entered automobiles and
started with the sheriff as a prisoner
for Ottawa, just as the fire depart
ment was called out. The chemical
trucks were run through the streets
to disperse the mob on foot.
When the motor mob reached Ottawa
they found their prisoner gone.
and during the confusion Sheriff Eley
of
escaped. During the remainder
the night it was momentarily expect
that the mob would re- form in
ed
upon the return of the motor
party Lima.
