RED ROCK WOULD HANG HIM
Oklahoma Town is Unhealthy Place
for Man Whom Sheriff Has
Captured.
KANSAS CITY, Mo., March 20.- A spe
cial to the Times from Perry, Okl., says:
Sheriff Foster and deputies returned today
from eighteen miles east of Perry, having
in their custody a wounded man giving his
name as Charles Johnson, and three horses.
From all indications the man was Ben
Cravens' companion in the Red Rock mur
der and robbery last Monday night, in
which Alvin Bateman, the bookkeeper of
Swartz& Co., was killed.
Johnson has a bullet hole in his wrist,
the ball lodging in the upper arm under
the shoulder, and another wound in the
head. He says he was held up Monday
night in the Otoe reservation and was shot
with a load of buckshot by two men who
robbed him, taking his coat and horse. It
is the general opinion here that Johnson
is the robber that was dressed in woman's
attire at the killing at Red Rock and received
the wounds from
Alvin Bateman
,
the bookkeeper who was killed in the raid.
The Perry militia has been called out to
guard the jail, as it is feared that an at
tempt will be made to lynch the prisoner
by enraged citizens of Red Rock who may
come here upon learning of the capture.
After the Red Rock murder, Sheriff Foster
traced the bandits to the home of a man
named Cunningham, near Pawnee, and the
house was surrounded. A demand was
made for the surrender of the men and
in reply a volley of bullets was fired into
the posse. Deputy Sheriff Johnson was
mortally wounded, and in the melee the
bandits again escaped in the timber
made for the reservation. and
