DRUNK AS A LORD.
Major Dick Young has offended
a local blackguard by referring to
colored people as" niggers." This,
says the upstart, is" only done by
uncultured whites." Well, there
The
are negroes and niggers.
negro is a type of the black race.
The nigger is a sort of a missing
link, who sets himself up as a
critic of white men and a judge of
the morals of white women, while
he lacks the common decency and
politeness of the negro. The niggersweil
is a rape fiend down south and
when he comes north he abuses
white folks in way. The
negro is all right. The nigger is
the only good excuse for lynching
we ever knew.- Salt Lake Herald.
The editor of the Herald has
become very wrothy because we
have classed him with the uncultured
whites and after endeavoring
,
to hide his manly and cowardly
form behind the coat tails of the
Hon. R. W. Young, he goes on to
say that the" nigger is a sort of
missing link who sets himself up as
a critic of white men and a judge
of the morals of white women."
Well! well! Whoever thought
that the editor of the Herald would
fall so low, and his fall is proof
positive to us that he is a thorough
and complete product of the poor
white trash. By his process of
reasoning he would like to com
monize all the whites. For example
, several months ago a negro
and a white woman were arrested
in Savannsh, Ga., for unlawfully
living together. But the editor of
the Herald would deny the right of
every negro editor, if he could,
from referring to this incident
upon the ground that the woman is
a fit subject to mingle with the best
society, simply because she hap
pens to possess a white skin. The
same chain of reasoning which he
uses would prevent negro editors
from referring to Miss Polly Smith
who is engaged in business on Commercial
street in this city.
But this shows that the editor
of the Herald has become so
steeped in race prejudice that he
an theng to separate the moral
anwilling
is
from
his desire to place all the members
of his race on the same level or
plane.
It has been our pleasure to be
presented to Mrs. Grover Cleveland
, Mrs. W. J. Bryan, Mrs.
Palmer and Mrs. A. S.
Potter
Trude of Chicago, and hundreds of
first class ladies, and we feel
other confident that none of those whom
we have met would sustain the
position which the editor of the
Herald has assumed. These ladies
would not want to be placed on the
same level with immoral women.
But the genial editor of the Herald
thinks that all whites look and act
alike to him, and that no negro
upstart should be permitted to
criticise those who do not measure
up to the proper standard of moral
ity and decency.
Many of the very best white
ladies of this city and state have
without hesitation expressed their
unqualified and highest approv-
which the
al of the course
Broad Ax has pursued in defend
ing true and noble womanhood and
at the same time they have ex
pressed their disapproval of the
editor of the Herald for being un
able to distinguish a true lady from
one who has become otherwise.
7 The gentlemanly(?) and cultured
editor of the Herald has now
become as drunk as a lord on the
race problem and refers to us as a
" blackguard." It is indeed very
singular but nevertheless true that
whenever any editor becomes a
blackguard he invariably endeavors
to spread his blackguardism
over others, and we know of one
such editor in Utah. He likens us
unto rape fiend for no other
reason the than that we have dared to
refer to the undisputable fact that
over two thousand white gentlemen
Louisiana, the leaders of
of
society are constantly en
gaged in sustaining unlawful rela
tions with women But he
negro
perfectly will-
.
no doubt would be
ing to assist to mob end lynch us
for referring to this fact. He
would be willing to help to burn us
at the stake for criticising white
gentlemen who paint their faces
black and commit outrages upon
their own females and then cast the
odium upon the negro. If we are
to be dubbed a rape fiend for referring
to these facts well and good.
But what shall we call the white
scoundrels and villians who have
become so debased and
as to commit such crimes? degraded
