" We Stopped Their
Lynching," Young
Negro Woman Tells
Relates How Negro Croppers and White
Workers in South Carolina Dispersed Lynch
Mob by Determined Resistance
An Interview by Boris Israel
" It was my brother," she tells me in a husky low tone, which carries
in itself a whole world of bottled up determination." That's how I know
this so well."
She is a young, clean- cut woman, slender, supple, a strong mouth,
nervous hands, and eyes which Negro can flash surprisingly into fighting flame
through their softness. She sits
restlessly, telling me of how the work
ers in the Carolinas had actually
stopped lynchings by action.
Rape Accusation
It was her brother who had been
accused of attacking a white woman
in Fort Mill, South Carolina. The accusing
woman had been meeting a
friend secretly and, on the point of
being discovered one night, screamed
that a Negro had attacked her. A
round- up was made and, pressed, she
had said," I think that looks like the
one."
Storekeepers closed their stores, bar
bers came out of their shops with
their customers and loungers, the pool
rooms were emptied, and the world
ew through the town like wildfire.
From somewhere a rope. appeared. It
was in the spring of the year and the
word travelled, too, through the fields
where the Negroes were chopping the
cotton and plowing the fields.
Lynch for Lynch
" They threw down their hoes and
they said it was going to be lynch
for ch." It all happened so quick
ly. But when the lynchers appeared
the jailhouse surrounded
by the Negro workers. The orders
were announced:" You don't come
within a block of this jailhouse. You
touch that boy and we will take care
of th lying white women."
There was no lynching in Fort Mill
that day.
" That was even before we knew how
to organize," it is explained." We just
organized for that time because we
had to do it. Now we can do it
better." Comrade Mary Welch is now
a leader of the, she is a Bolshevik
. She tells workers again of Green
ville, S. C., where the Ku Klux Klan
had been maintaining a reign of terror
against workers' organizations.
K. K. K. Stops Meetings
" If maybe three or four of us
women would stand and talk together
on the street they'd come up and ask
us what kind of meeting we was holding
, and what we was talking about."
Any meeting in a house was raided
by these mobs, led by the police and
the cotton mill overseers. Then the
leaders would be taken miles away
from the town, clubbed and beaten
and left in the ditch." Anyways, we
kept growing and building the organ-
ization," this comrade says, simply.
" Then one white storekeeper picks
on one of our members, about his girl
-says this young Negro 27 has insulted
him cause he went with his
own colored girl.
Talked Back to White
" Our comrade, he took up for him
self and told the man so, and that
night they passed around the word
to go get that boy and to lynch him."
Mary Welch called some of the members
of the I. L. D. and the union
together. They met in the house of
one of the workers.
" I explained to them what it was
all about and what the white bosses
was fixing to do.
" We decided we was going to stop
this here lynching. We said even if
some of us do get killed we was sure
to defend ourselves." They went
the home of the young prospective to
victim of the mob and hid him some
where else.
" It was about thirty- five of us. It
was twenty- eight men and two
women.
They crowded into the small, two
room home and each took what he
or she could for a weapon." We had
chair backs and pieces of wood and
hoes and the woman of the house, she
had a shot gun in bed with her.
" If they come in to mob us, we're
going to fight till we die," they decided
. Comrade Welch gave instructions
. She explained that they could
get guns from some of the mob.
Defend Ourselves
" When the fight starts. Just don't
start nothing. But we can sure de
fend ourselves." They waited. In that
stifling cabin, packed in with a space
about the door and papers tacked
over the windows, they waited.
Cars drove into the street and
stopped. The Klan mob was out in
force. There were between thirty and
thirty- five autos, according to a count
made. Two of the white mob leaders,
a policeman one of them, threw open
the door.
" They was surprised to see us there.
They thought they was just going to
take that young boy out alone, beat
up his mammy and papa and string
him up to a tree. They wanted to
know what was we doing there.
" They started searching the men
folks but the man of the house he
wouldn't let them search him for his
pistol. There was a little bit of a
rumpus. Then the rest of the mob
men came up there.
I Pushed Back
" I jumped to the Him door and pushed
, the first of them back and told them
they better stay out cause we in
tended defending ourselves. They
looked at the comrade in the bed with
the shotgun raised up at them and
then they saw another comrade
through the door and he had a gun,
too, so they ran back to their autos.
" Every one of us stood our ground."
The two mob" leaders" begged to be
allowed to leave, they begged for
mercy, for their lives, they promised.
They left." They couldn't get out of
there fast enough," Mary Welch says,
a quick, flickering smile turning her
lip- corners up and lighting her face.
We Went Ahead
There is a note of triumph in her
voice as she says," After that time,
they didn't try to break up no more
meetings. We went ahead and they
never bothered us again the way they
had been doing.
She tells me of a perhaps even
more significant incident in Charlotte,
North Carolina, just this year. The
organizer for the Young Communist
League, a young Negro worker, was
accused of insulting a white girl and
a mob was forming. Ten white mill
workers heard of the plan and spread
the word.
Ten white mill workers in the south
spread the word:" Lynching. A lynch
ing is scheduled. They're going to
lynch the Y. C. L. organizer." And
when the lynch mob formed they
were faced with workers, white and
black, who told them:" You don't
lynch him before you lynch us."
He Wasn't Lynch
He wasn't lynched. Mary Welch
explains." Those men that carry you
out and beat you up or hang you to
a tree- they don't want to die any
more than you do.
" Start right when they start, start
before they start, and organize our
forces against this lynching.
" If they can organize forces to take
a Negro out and him, we can
organize enough to lynch prevent them!"
