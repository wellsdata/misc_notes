LYNCHING RECORD
FOR FOUR MONTHS
From the New York World.
From May 1 to August 23, twenty- one
lynchings, with an aggregate of thirty
three victims, were reported in the United
States. 1
By states these were distributed as fol

Of these twenty- one were negroes and
twelve whites.
The attributed causes were: Assault on
women, 12; assault on men, 5( the five Italians
killed in Louisiana); aiding escaping
murderers, 3; for lynching, 3; murder, 3;
theft, 3; robbery, 4; arson, 1; race war
( whitecaps), 1.
The brief report of the cases printed be
low show that in several cases the lynch
in one instance
crs were negroes, who
lynched one of their own race for the
crime wich more frequently than any
other prompts whites to lynch negroes. In
another they aided a mob of whites in
lynching a negro, and in a third they
lynched two negroes for the crime of
lynching.
Records for fourteen years show that
lynchings are less numerous in the months
covered by the above figures than in other
seasons of the year. But, assuming that
the period covered represents an average
for the year, it is seen that there is a very
marked decrease in the crime to be re
corded for 1899. Estimating from the figures
given, it is reasonable to hope that
the total number of cases this year will
not exceed one hundred, whereas the aver
age number of lynchings reported annually
since 1885 is one hundred and sixty- eight.
The highest number was in 1892, when the
total was 235; the lowest in 1887, when
there were 122.
Governors Aroused
Several governors have taken vigorous
measures to bring the people of their states
to a realizing sense of the disgrace the law
less rule of lynchers fastens upon them,
and the decrease in the crime is
doubtless due in some measure to
such efforts. In Texas Governor Sayers'
efforts resulted in the indictment for mur
der of eight men charged with lynching
Humphries and his two sons, and the cases
against the defendants are being vigorously
Pushed.
In Georgia a man named Hamilton, ar
rested as one of a mob which lynched a
negro, has made a confession implicating
a number of citizens of Gainesville, and
their vigorous prosecution by the state is
promised.
