-Facts have come to light since the
lynching of Schell at Bellefontaine, Ohio,
for the supposed outrage and murder of a
young woman named Laughlin, which
make it probable that not he, but his wife,
on whose testimony he was hanged, was
really guilty of the murder, The micro
soopic examination of some hair, which the
murdered girl held clutched in her hands,
shows it was not Schell's hair, as at
first supposed that, but his wife's.
