TWO MORE LYNCHINGS.
Louisiana and Alabama Mobs String
Up Negro Fiends.
NEW IBERIA, La., July 21.- About 7:30
o'clock this morning, at Baldwin, in St.
Mary's parish, a negro, Jack Davis, alias
" Buddy Jack," was hanged by the citizens
of the town for criminally assaulting widow
Marcol, who had been during the early
hours of the morning at the house of Dr.
Fecot, living near Scranton. The fiend way
laid the woman and, brutally struggled with
her. Her screams aroused Michael Peck,
who chased the negro to the store of Bee
ders& Deliah, where, on being recognized,
he was seized, rushed to the bayou bank
at the edge of the town and strung up. He
implicated another negro, Willis Jewell,
who, after being severely whipped, was ordered
to leave the town. All excitement is
allayed and no further trouble is
pated. antici
