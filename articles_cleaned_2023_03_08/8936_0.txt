" BAD JOE"
HANGED
After He Had Held the Whole Community
of a Missouri Town in Fear
for Years- Something of
Thornton's Exploits. Joo
Joplin, Mo., July 17.- Twenty- two
years ago tonight occurred Joplin's
most memorable lynching bee, with
the town's most famous and fear
some" bad man" playing the principal
role in the obsequies. The date
is one long to be remembered by the
older citizens of" the town that Jack
built," since it marked the beginning
of the end of the wild and lawless
mining camp. With the passing out
of" Bad Joe" Thornton at the end of
a rope a change come over the fron
tier village. The four- flushing" gun
man" who had bulldozed the people
of the incipient city was left without
a leader and immediately left for the
wilder West or retired into innocuous
deseutude. In the lawless affair of
July 18, 1885, the present comparatively
peaceful and quiet zinc metrop.
olis had its beginning.
" Bad Joe" Thornton came to Joplin
in the summer of 1884 and established
a thirst quenching resort near the
Kansas line. Prohibition was then
prohibiting in the Sunflower State,
and Thornton carried on a brisk
business in liquors of a kind that
were guaranteed to kill or maim at
forty rods. In addition to maddening
moisture, Joseph kept a large stock of
trouble on hand at all times. His
place became a hang- out for all the
toughs within a hundred miles and
the orgies -- some of them exceedingly
bloody- that took place under his
auspices were sufficient to shock
anyone not wholly lost to a sense of
decency.
Whenever he tired of the society of
his" bad men" friends, which was
very often, Thornton came to Joplin
and proceeded to paint the town. His
reign while in the city was complete
and no one dared deny his slightest
wish. He was the dictator of Joplin
and not even the hardiest of the
town's officers dared deny his supremacy
- none except old" Dad"
Sheehan." Dad," a fearless Irishman,
attempted to arrest Thornton, and
was shot down like a dog by
the

man." resistance
," Bad Joe" was captured by
a mob and hanged. It was the town's
first lynching bee." Bad Joe" was the
last of his kind in Joplin. The dang
ling body was a warning to all other
" bad men" that their society was no
longer wanted, and they immediately
proceeded to betake themselves
hence.
Old settlers in this city tell many
stories of Thornton's exploits. Ac
cording to their weird tales, the bor
der ruffian of fiction has been under
drawn rather than exaggerated. Like
most men of his type," Bad Joe" was
proud of his marksmanship and his
chief joy was to shoot cigars from
the mouths of startled tenderfeet and
to perforate their silk hats. To the
mirthful Joe all men were but tar
gets. A hatless frightened man run
ning down the streets of Joplin was
a sure sign that" Bad Joe" was in
town and had been testing his shoot
ing irons. As an unique character,
Thornton has the edge on all other
Joplinites, and his untimely demise
is still mourned by a few admirers of
lurid fiction who have never had the
pleasure meeting a real" bad man"
in the flesh of.
