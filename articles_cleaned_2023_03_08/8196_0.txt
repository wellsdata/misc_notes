TREE. A HANGING TO
Where the Body of a Would- Be Ravisher
was Found.
ZENIA, O., June 18.- Peter Betters, colored
, made a desperate attempt Saturday
night to rape and murder an old colored
woman named Martha Thomas, living at
Jamestown. A most desperate struggle en
sued, in which the old lady was terribly
mangled, and was unconscious when found.
The alarm was given and the assallant ar
rested, but broke through the guard and
escaped. The neighborhood was greatly
excited over the affair and the fugitive
negro hunted down. In the fair grounds,
where the cyclone played such fearful havoc
some time ago, are many trees bent by the
storm and making excellent gallows. To
one of these the body of Betters was
found hanging this( Monday) morning, cold
and dead. Whether by the mob or by
his own hand cannot hung be determined.
