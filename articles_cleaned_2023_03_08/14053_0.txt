Blame? Who's to Murder:
Daily Times Minneapolis Editorial(
Down near Monroe, Ga., the other
day a mob dragged two Negro
couples out of a car and killed

if it had been well planned. While
the bodies were still warm and
the mob melted into the
bleeding,

By the perverted code of lynch
law it had done a good day's work,

But by the standards of
justice and human decency, it had
the state of Georgia and
befouled shamed the whole nation.
Question: Who was responsible
this cowardly and despicable
for act?
Not the Ku Klux Klan, surely!
No the Klan" had nothing to do"
with it. There are not even any
Klansmen in Monroe, says Samuel
Green the august Grand Dragon
,
of that hooded order. The conscience
of the Klan is white as driven snow,
for it does condone such savagery
. not
The Klan does not advocate
lynehings in its public ceremonials.
It does not wear" Murder" embroidered
on its fancy night- shirts
The Ku Klux Klan only sows the
little seeds of bigotry and hatred,
It only implants the virulent
poisons of race prejudice in warped
and vengeful minds. It only whips
up latent angers, and moulds them
into violent forms. But the Klan,

Let us search further, then. What
Talmadge, Georgia's
of Eugene
governor- elect? Does he bear any
part of black burden of responsibility
for what has happened
at Monroe? Why no, obviously, for
out in Cheyenne, Wyo., where Mr.
Talmadge vacations after victory,
he looks with pious disapproval on
the crime. It is, he says," an act
to be regretted."
A pale word, to be sure- regretted
- and yet it is clear that Georgia's
red- gallused statesman has no
stomach such violent goings-
on. Mr. Talmadge for does not advo-
cate lynchings. He does not wear
an outline of the gallows on his
shining political escutcheon. So far
as we know, he has never championed
lynch law from the hust-
ings of his native state.
No, Gene Talmadge only feeds
the fires of race warfare. He only
stumps the state for" white su

and
scatters

hatreds in his wake. He only stirs
up the dregs of bitterness in stupid
minds, and through artful political
the baser pas-
appeals arouses
Tal-

sions of the bigot. Does Mr.
madge, then, bear no responsibility
for the massacre at Monroe? Why

conscience is obviously clean
madge and clear.
But if not the Klan, and if not
Mr. Talmadge, who? Senator Bilbo
of Mississippi, who advocates" persuasive
" methods with the Negro?
Representative Rankin who joins
,
him in blatant bigotry? Are
with they in any way responsible?
Perish the thought- these gentle-
men merely sow the unpretentious
winds of hate that later must be
reaped as whirlwinds of disaster.
The responsibility for Monroe
does not rest here, either- save as
who seeks to
it rests on everyone
divide the American people, who
separates them with a wedge of
hatred and distrust, who preaches
the master race philosophies, who
sets
side as inferior, and unworthy of
the rights intended for the
as a people
In that sense, the crime of Mon
roe is inseparable from the hooded
Klansmen, from the Talmadges and
Bilbos and Rankins, and from all
of those who attempt, either privately
or officially, to foster the
of race hatred in this
country doctrines.
The mob kills, but it is the bigot
in high places who gives false
courage to the mob. The embers of
violence need to be fanned with
ignorance and intolerance before
they burst into a livid flame.
In fixing the responsibilities for
Monroe then, look carefully for all
who bear, a fan.
