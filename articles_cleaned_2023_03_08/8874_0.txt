Irvin Welbourne, of this city, made a
speech in which he vigorously scored F.
B. Doran, Fred C. Schiffmann, Judge Hine
and J. J. McCardy. He spoke with particular
feeling of the remarks of Mr. Mc
Cardy regarding the lynching of the negro
at Leavenworth, Kan., and said that those
words in themselves should be sufficient
to prevent any negro from ever
a vote for Mr. McCardy. casting
