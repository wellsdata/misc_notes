Lynchings in Georgia
( Editorial in Minneapolis Star- Journal
Perhaps it isn't reasonable to hold)
Eugene Talmadge, Georgia's former
and future governor, responsible
for the lynching of four Ne-
groes the other day. But the hate
philosophy which motivated the assassins
was the same that Tal
madge espoused in his recent campaign
- the supposed supremacy
native- born whites, of
That sort of" idealism" purposes
the reviving Ku Klux Klan and
was the battle cry for Rankin and
Bilbo before the recent Mississippi
election. It is not explanation
enough, even though the former
governor of Mississippi made it in
Minneapolis yesterday, to say that
Mississippians were showing their
resentment at the interference of
Drew Pearson and Walter Winchell
when they Bilbo and Rankin
back into congress voted.
To the credit of Georgia the
,
popular vote went against Tal-
madge. But the unit vote at
least two units for the least populated
counties and no more than
six for the largest- gave the small,
backward" cracker" strongholds
predominant voice in the selection
of a governor. They chose one of
the most vicious- minded men ever
to appear in polities succeed
Georgia's finest executive to.
And now, in one of those backward
communities, four Negroes
- only one of them guilty of any
lawbreaking- have been killed to
appease the white man's rage. Only
it won't be appeased. The election
of Talmadge didn't appease any
thing. It gave encouragement instead
to the kind of lawbreaking
he and Bilbo openly advocate.
The conscience of a whole nation
is heavily weighted by the outof
some southerners who
bursts resent Yankee interference.
