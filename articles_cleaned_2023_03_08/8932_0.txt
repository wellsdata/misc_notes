are beartily sick of the reign of lynch law,
admit that the time is coming, if the
tide and of lawlessness is not stemmed, when
accusation, a specious circumstance," as
negroes are today.
Chief Justice Bleckley, of Georgia, denounces
mob law with ansparing vigor.
He affirms that mobs could not exist if we
" could alter the tone and teaching of the
public journals which confound the mob
with the people and describe mob violence
as cases in which the people act in their
own behalf and take justice into their own
hands." Lynch law is not the act of" the
people." The men who form an ordinary
lynching party are not the people," nor
even any part of it. Jadge Bleckley says:
" Were is known by actual count that all
the people of both sexes and all ages had
assembled and combined by unanimous
consent to perpetrate an act of violence
upon the worst of criminals the case
would not be one in which the people had
taken justice into their own hands, but
one in which, in violation of their own
law, they had sesamed to inflict injustice
in the name of justice. The people have
no hands for unlawful work. Justice is in
the hands of the people only when it is
in the hands of their organized tribunals,
.. Should a mob pass and promulgate
a statute or a body of statutes,
would it be said that the people had taken
the making of the laws into their own
hands? What journal or newspaper would
venture speak thus of such a lawless
method of to making laws?"
