Negro Is Lynched.
Little Rock, Ark., April 7.- John Tur
ner, colored, was lynched at Warren,
Ark., last night for an attempted assault
of Mrs. W. H. Neeley, a white
woman who resides about seven miles
west of town. This attempt occurred
last Friday and the negro was arrested
Saturday and taken before Mrs. Neeley
who was positive in her identification.
Shortly after midnight a mob broke in
to the county jail and, taking Turner
out, strung him to a limb in front of
the court house where several other
negroes have been lynched at different
times. Turner denied his guilt to the
last.
