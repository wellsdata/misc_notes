Alabama Lyncher Convicted.
George Howard, a prominent citizen of
Elmore county, Alabama, who was im.
plicated in the lynching of a negro recently
, was found guilty of murder in
the first degree, Friday, and the penalty
fixed at a life sentence in the penitentiary
. The trial occurred at Wetumpka
and lasted but one day. Howard was
charged with being one of a party of
white men who recently lynched Robert
White, a negro, for shooting and wound-
ing a white man. Howard made a full
confession in court, telling how he and
twelve others waylaid the officer, took
the negro, and hanged him to a tree in a
swamp. He gave the names of his alleged
associates. Two men are on trial
for the same crime and four others are
under indictment. This is the first time
in the state's history that a member of
a lynching party has been convicted.
The jury which brought in verdict
was composed exclusively of white the men.
