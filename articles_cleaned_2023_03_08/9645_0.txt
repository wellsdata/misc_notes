PREVENTED A LYNCHING.
Parents of an Outraged Child Save the
Black Brute's Life.
Chicago, Jan. 29.- A dispatch to the
Tribune from Washington, Ga., says:
Following a criminal assault on a
10- year- old girl by a negro, who was
captured by a mob, the assailant's fate
was in doubt yesterday while the par
ents of the girl were pleading for and
against burning him at the stake.
Mrs. Roberts, weeping, begged that
the law be allowed to take its course,
and her husband continued to incite the
mob to lynch the negro. She then appealed
to her husband to aid her in
peventing the lynching. She said that
to put the assailant to death within the
hearing of the girl would be almost as
cruel to the child as the negro's act.
Roberts, after some hesitation, came
to his wife's side and joined his en
treaties with her. The united efforts
convinced the mob that to lynch the ne
gro would add to the wrong already
done the child, and it was agreed to
turn the assailant over to the sheriff.
Mamle Roberts was attacked Saturday
as she was returning from a neighbor's
home by Rich Anderson, a negro
employed by her father. As soon as
the child reached her home with the
story, posses with bloodhounds began
pursuit of Anderson. The negro was
captured yesterday in a swamp and
taken to Roberts' home, where it was
planned to have him identified by the
child, and then lynch him. When the
arrived at the Roberts home the
negro mob confessed his guilt.
