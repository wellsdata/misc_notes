During Governor Crittenden's administration
he was importuned by
an intelligent and lovely little daugh-
ter while on her death bed to pardon
one Charles Stevenson, from Noda-
way county, who had been sent to
the penitentiary for twelve years for
murder in the second degree. The
child had, when in health, made
many visits to the penitentiary,
where Stevenson had shown her
some attention, and had presented
her with trinkets which he had made
when not employed at prison labor,
and thus had caused the governor's
daughter to take an interest in se
his pardon governor
curing. The
yielded to the wish of his dying
child and on the day he retired frcm
oflice signed Stevenson's pardon.
Stevenson returned to Nodaway
county and in less than a month shot
man for which he was taken
another from the jail by a mob and hung.
