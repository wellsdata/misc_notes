MOB HANGS DOUBLE MURDERER
AT NEWCASTLE.
HEAD IS TORN FROM RODY
Owing to Great Depth of Fall Given
Victim Hanging Results in
Decapitation.
News has been received of a lynching
at Newcastle, Wyo., last Tuesday
night. The mob is claimed to have
been composed cf ranchers from
Gillette and vicinity and the victim
of its vengeance was W. C. Clifton,
who according to his own confession,
was a double murderer.
Clifton was awaiting trial for the
killing of John W. Church and wife,
who lived on a ranch about 75 miles
southwest of Newcastle.
The last time the couple were seen
alive was March 14, last. April 7
Clifton, whose ranch adjoined theirs,
was arrested on suspicion of having
murdered them and several days after
ward he made a confession in which
he admitted that he killed Church
and his wife, but claimed that it was
done in self defense. He told where
he had concealed the bodies and they
were found at the place indicated.
In relating the occurrences that ended
in the murder he said that he had
given Church a bili of sale covering
personal property to secure payment
of$ 600 which Church had advanced
him. He claimed that he repaid
Church and had obtained return of
the bill of sale, but Mrs. Church had
threatened him with a revolver and
demanded that he give the bill back.
He admitted that he shot the woman
and then being attacked by the
husband shot and killed him also.
story was not believed, as Mrs.
His Church was a delicate, little woman
of about 22 years. Her husband was
formerly employed as a stenographer
in the Union Pacific offices at Omaha
and was known as a peaceable and
well disposed man. About a year ago
he and Clifton made an agreement
to go into the cattle business together
in Wyoming and he took up a home
stead adjoining that of Clifton. The
supposition is that Clifton committed
the murder in order to possess him
self of the property owned by the
Churches.
Head Torn from Body.
About 50 men composed the mob
that did the lynching. It was well
organized and worked with expedition.
The sheriff and nis deputies were
overcome and bound and then placed
in one of the cells of the jail. Clif
ton was taken out and a gag put in
his mouth to stifle his cries. After
his hands and feet haa been bound he
was dragged to a bridge west of town
from which he was hanged.
The rope used was so long that the
length of the drop given him caused
his head to be torn from the body
and the latter fell into the gully
crossed by the bridge, 40 feet below.
The body was permitted to remain
where it had fallen until the next
day.
Law Too Slow.
Pinned to the body was the follow
ing note:
" We think the law too slow in hang
ing this most coldblooded murderer
who took the lives of our friends
and neighbors, and we took it upon
ourselves to revenge it in behalf of
the parents. Hoping that the action
on our part will meet with the appro
val of the community at large, we
