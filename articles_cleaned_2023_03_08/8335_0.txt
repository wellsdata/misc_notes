â€”
Yreka, Cal., Aug. 26.- Four murderers
were taken from the county jail by a
mob of 250 men at o'clock this morning
and lynched. A band of citizens, fear-
ing that the law would not be carried
out and angered over the atrocity of re
cent crimes, determined to take matters
into their own hands. The lynching
was the ghastly climax to the reign of
lawlessness which
has prevailed in
Siskiylou county for some months past.
One of victims was Lawrence
Johnson, who on the evening of July
28 stabbed his wife to death in the town
of Etna. Another was William Null,
who shot Henry Hayter in the back
Louis Moreno and Garland Seemler,
who are supposed to have killed George
Sears and Casper Meirerhans at Bailey
Hill on August 5 were also hanged.
At 11 o'clock last night farmers from
all of the surrounding country began to
drive into town, and by midnight the
mob was ready to march to the county
jail. Before taking a step, however,
every precaution was taken to prevent
the plans of the lynchers being frustrated
by the officers of the law. The
sheriff and one of his deputies were de
toyed to another part of town by two
members of the mob who were engaged
in a sham fight and the fire bell was
muffled to prevent an alarm being given
in that way.
When the jail was reached a number
of the men, all of whom were masked,
awakened Under Sheriff Radford and
demanded the keys from him. He positively
refused to open the door or give
the keys up, telling them that if they
broke in the doors he would blow their
brains out. Finding that Radford was
determined not to give them the keys
they went across to the jail and got on
top of the stone wall which surrounds
the jail.
TAKEN ONE BY ONE.
Deputy Sheriff Henry Brahtlacht,
who has been sleeping in the jail since
the commitment of so many murderers,
thinking some one was escaping from
the jail, fired two shots out of the win
dow to alarm City Marshal Parks and
Deputy Sheriff Radford. He then open
ed the doors and was immediately held
up by the mob who took the keys from
him and entered the jail. Having no
keys to the different cells they were
compelled to burst the locks with a
sledge hammer, which they proceeded
to do at once.
Lawrence H. Johnson, who brutally
stabbed his wife to death at Etna on
Sunday evening, July 28, was the first
to receive the attention of the mob.
They broke the lock from the door of
his cell and placing a rope around his
neck, led him out of the jail and across
the street to where an iron rail was laid
between the forks of two locust trees.
Johnson pleaded for mercy but the
silent gathering gave no heed to his ap
peals and he was quickly strung up,
dying from strangulation in a few min
utes.
The mob returned to the jail and next
broke into the cell of William Null, who
shot Henry Hayter at Callahan's on
April 21 in a dispute over a mining
property. Null desired to make a state
ment, but time was too valuable to per
mit any such preliminaries, and he was
soon hanging alongside of Johnson.
Louis Moreno, who was charged with
having killed George Sears on the 5th
of this month, was then taken from his
cell and was soon swinging with John
son and Null.
REMEMBERED HIS MOTHER.
The last and youngest of the four
nurderers to pay the penalty of his
crime was Garland Seemler, aged 19,
who in company with Moreno was
charged with having killed Casper
Merierhans at Bailey Hill on the 5th of
this month. A rope was placed around
Seemler's neck and he was led from the
jail in his bare feet. Seemler begged
for mercy, and his last words were:
" Tell my dear old mother I am innocent
of the crime."
About this time Sheriff Hobbs, having
been notified, arrived on the scene and,
starting for the jail door, was commanded
to halt, the command being em
hasized by the display of several revolvers
. He was told that the" job had
been done." By this time the greater
part of the mob had dispersed, leaving
only about thirty or forty men on
guard, who soon left after the sheriff
arrived.
The bodies were taken down by Cor
oner Schofield and Marshal Parks, who
removed them in a wagon to an engine
house, where they were laid side by
side. The coroner has summoned a
jury to hold an inquest.
Yreka is a little mining town and yars
ago was frequently the scene of mob
violence. The sumary manner in which
justice was meted to the four murderers
this morning reminded the pioneers of
similar scenes during the gold excite-
ment forty years ago when it was not
an uncommon spectacle to awaken in
the morning and see the body of a notorious
criminal dangling from a tree.
DEATH RATHER THAN SHAME.
Max Koack Murders a Woman Who Wil
Reformed.

Sioux City, Iowa, Aug. 26.- In a
house of ill- fame yesterday occurred
what was probably murder and suicide
. Max Noack of Marcusia was
found dead in a room with a bullet
in his brain. By his side lay Hazel
Hammond, an inmate of the house,
with a bullet in her head. The lamp had
been overturned and the clothing of
the dead man had commenced to burn
when the tragedy was discovered. It
is believed that Noack was trying to
get the woman, who was a half- sister
of his wife, to leave the life she was
leading and when she refused shot

BUT THIS IS ANOTHER STORY.
Murder and Suicide May be Double Murder
with Robbery as the Motive.
Stoux City, Ia., Aug. 26.- Sunday
morning's double tragedy in a house of
ill- fame now seems likely to prove to be
a double murder instead of a murder
and a suicide. Ora Minter, alias Hazel
Hammond, who was found with a
bullet wound in her head beside the dead
body of Max Noack, who had also been
shot, died today without regaining
consciousness. The death of the girl de
the hope of the police that she
stroys would be able to throw some light on
