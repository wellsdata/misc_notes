A BRUTAL MURDER.
An Old Citizen of Woodford Coun
ty, III., Shot Down in the street.
CHICAGO, May 8.- Walter Bullock,
a lawyer and an old citizen of Wood
ford County, was shot and instantly
killed at El Paso, Ill., last night by P.
C. Ran- om, who was badly defeated
in the recent municipal election for
Mayor. Bullock was standing on
West Front street talking to a friend
and made some remark about the election
as Ransom passed by. Ransom
stopped and ordered bim to retract his
words, and upon his refusal to do 80
pulled a revolver and shot him three
times, once through the head, then
through the heart and once through
the shoulder. Bullock fell, gasped
two or three times and died. Ransom
walked down the street and waited in
front of the bank building until he was
arres' ed. He was followed to jail by
an infuriated mob, crying" Lynch
him," but no attempt was made to interfere
with the officers. The feeling
against Ransom in the community
night was very bitter. last
