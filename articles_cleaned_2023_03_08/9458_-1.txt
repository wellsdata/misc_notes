Still, the state of excitement as seen in the
streets at any time is easily exaggerated.
Everywhere were to be heard expressions of
sympathy with the President and his family,
of regret that such reproach should be brought
against the American name and institutions
through the action of a lunatic or fanatic, of
wrath against him and others of his ilk. But
the talk of" lynch law" was rare and there
were but few minutes, probably, when violence
was to be feared. The papers tell of the
scene about the depot between the time of the
shooting and the time of the President's removal
as one of wild confusion. This is
true. The crowd was immense but it was not
quiet and circulation through it was easy. The
interference of the police was not once really
necessary, except to issue directions. Even
when the President was brought out to the
ambulance there was no clamor. Those standing
near raised their hats in token of respect
and with a little clearing of the way the procession
hurried to the White House. It was a
serious crowd, quieted by horror. The anxious
throng that stood all day before the White
House was of the same kind. Every precaution
was taken by the authorities, as was
proper, but I do not believe there has been
danger of mob since the first half hour after
the news began a to spread.
