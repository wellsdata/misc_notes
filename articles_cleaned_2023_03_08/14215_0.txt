MY DEAR SIR: Commodore Jones has but this moment informed
me that the Ohio will sail to- day for Mazatlan,
and I take the opportunity for forwarding a few public
letters. I also enclose two or three private letters, this
you please to have them sent to the post office in Wash

Since I last wrote to you, the affairs of this country have Clay

of lawless the most been

The people are now acting in self- defence; and four or

which, I am informed, were correctly sent from Mazatlan
to Vera Cruz about six weeks since. I have only time ner

rainy season has caused many to suspend their work. prove
There can be no doubt but that at least$ 4,000,000 of gold, -aye

to foreign countries, and, consequently, to foreign mints.
