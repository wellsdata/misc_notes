FIVE LYNCHED IN ARKANSAS.
Bodies of Three Mea and Twe Women
Dangling From a Tree.
LITTLE ROCK, Aug. 11.- Five negroes
are hanging from the limbs of trees
near the railroad track and the widow
of John T. Orr is dead in her cell.
This is the tragie denouement of the
assassination of John T. Orr, a
wealthy merchant, a few nights ago.
The wife died from a dose of poison,
self- administered, while the negroes,
her associates in crime, were strung
up by a mob of citizens.
Miss Morris, the Jewess implicated
in the assasination, was not hanged,
she having disappeared. The lynched
are: Manse Castle, Dennis Ricord, Ella
Weaver, Susie Jacobs, Will Saunders.
Late Saturday night John T. Orr was
assassinated. He had just returned
from choir practice, where his wife
was organist. The crime was shrouded
In mystery until Miss Morris told
somebody that she knew who fired the
shot.
A coroner's inquest resulted in the
arrest of the five negroes and Mrs. Orr
and a warrant for Miss Morris. It
was charged that the wife had hired
the negroes to do the murder. Orr's
life was insured for$ 5,000 and it developed
at the inquest that Orr and his
wife had lived unhappily.
Mr. Orr was formerly a theatrical
man. In 1890 the couple eloped to a
summer resort in Wisconsin and were
married. Later they settled in Clarendon
, where Orr prospered in busi
ness and was considered weaithy
the time of his death. at
