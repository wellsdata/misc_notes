Turnpike raids, murders from am
bush and mob lynching parties in Kentucky
have driven the Legislature to
the enactment of stringent measures
to suppress this lawless element so
common within its borders. The Sen
ate of that State has passed a law
which requires jailers and other offcers
holding persons threatened by violence
to arm the prisoner that he may
defend himself, and to protect him
with the aid of a posse at the peril of
forfeiting his own office. It is questionable
which would be in the most
anger, a desperate criminal without
weapons, or his captors, providing he
armed
es.
