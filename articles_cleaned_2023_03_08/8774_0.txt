Mr. Van Beuren in the character of
Governor Philip Morrow in Edward
Sheldon's intensely dramatic play" The
Nigger," has a situation to face in
which he is compelled to either truckle
to the mob or become decidedly un
popular as a protector of a negro who
has committed the unmentionable
crime.
Pursued by a mob bent upon lynch
ing, the negro flees to the Morrow
plantation for protection, his old
" mammy" pleading with young Mor
row on her knees. The governor with
drawn revolver holds the crowd at
bay and tries to reason with them. To
their leader who stands ready with a
coil of rope over his arm Morrow says:
" I can understand down to the bot
tom what you want to do and why.
and it's human nature- I can under
stand that. But, for God's sake try
to jam down your feelings for a mo
ment and think, Remember that
to the crime
lynching is next worse
itself."
Finding that pleading has no effect
the blood- thirsty mob Morrow
on
hurls defiance at them." There's not
a man in this state. I don't care who
that could feel a
he is," he cries,"
deeper horror and disgust for such a
crime and such a criminal than I, but
you and your men have elected me
governor of this state to uphold the
law and now by Heaven you can't stop
me doing it."
Mr. Van Beuren is deeply interested
in the proceedings at the governors'
conference at Richmond in the mat
ter of the race problem, because of his
role in" The Nigger."
" I am quite in sympathy with the
position taken by Governor Morrow'
in the play," said the leading man to
day." Granted that the crime commit
ted deserves the must severe punish
ment under the law, there is no rea
son in the world why another and per
crime
as repulsive a
haps equally
should be committed by a body of citizens
in defiance of law and order. I
quite agree with Governor Shafroth of
Colorado who says that one mob can
de more injury to society than twenty
murderers.
" Although I am quite familiar with
of Southerners in the
the attitude
question of lynch law, having lived in
below the Mason and Dixon line for
several years, I cannot understand the
position of the governor of a state
who makes such radical utterances as
those attributed to Governor Blease of
South Carolinna.
" To my mind it is not a question
