ALIVE BURNED FLAYED AND
Terrible Punishment Meted Out to
Three Negroes
Little Doubt That the Assailants of Miss
Armstrong Florida Met Sum
mary in Punishment
MADISON, Fla., May 20.- There is no
longer any doubt that Sam Echoils, Sim
Crawley and John Brooks, the negroes
who outraged and murdered Miss Mamie
Armstrong in Lafayette county, were
flayed and burned.
A man who has just reached this place
from Lafayette county says the belief
is general that the negroes were tortured
to death. One man, who ventured into
the camp where the negroes were carried
asserts that he found the place where the
negroes were put to death. He says that
it was evident that the negroes were tied
to trees and the skin stripped froin them
with knives.
Then wood was heaped about the bleed
ing forms, the match applied, and the
wretches were soon dead. This man says
he found some strips of skin about the
place, which Lears out the belief that
they were flayed and burned.
Everything is quiet in Lafayette coun
ty, and there is no fear of trouble be
tween the races. The better class of negroes
denounce the outrage and murder
of Miss Armstrong as bitterly as the
whites. Twelve negroes have now been
lynched in six months, and it would seem
that the horrible fate of the last three
should prevent further attacks upon white
women. The whites have formed a band,
and are determined to protect their
and daughters. wives
