Within the past two months two gin-
houses, one cotton- house and more than
one hundred bales of cotton have been
burned in the neighborhood of Sidon,
Leflare County, Miss., by incendiaries.
Thomas and Terry Mack, two notorious
negrces, were arrested recently, charged
with the crime, and were brought to trial
before a justice of the peace. At the trial
the evidence was so strong against them
that the citizens became infuriated, and a
company of nearly one hundred masked
men, white and colored, took the
ers out and hung them. prison
