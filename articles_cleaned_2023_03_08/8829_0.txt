Weir City was the scene last night of
a double tragedy. Gus McArdle, bar

and killed at half past 10 o'clock and in
less than two hours, his supposed murderer
, George Wells, a negro miner from
Scammon, was swinging to a telephone
pole, the victim of a mob which had
forcibly taken him from jail.
Earlier in the evening McArdle and
Wells had some words in the saloon af
ter which the negro left. Shortly af
terwards a shot was fired from across
the street, the bullet striking McArdle
squarely in the forehead. He died in
half an hour.
A few minutes later Wells came up
in the crowd that collected and inquired
the cause of the commotion. A
spectator to the previous quarrel point
ed Wells out to an officer who arrested
him on suspicion and lodged him in
jail. Another spectator shortly after
wards identified him as the negro who
had quarreled with McArdle and the
report quickly spread that he was identified
as the man who did the killing.
A howling determined mob formed
quickly and marched to the jail. Se
curing Wells without much trouble they
dragged the frightened negro from the
building and strung him up to the
nearest telephone pole. Before the rope
was placed about his neck, Wells admitted
he was with the man who shot
McArdle, but denied that he had
the shooting. done
