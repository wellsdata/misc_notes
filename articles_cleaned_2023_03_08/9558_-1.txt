Faulkner's new book is powerful

ILLIAM FAULKNER'S In-
W
truder in the Dust( Random
House:$ 3.00) provokes
many heady problems revolving
around progressive writing.
Perhaps a meaningful comment
on the book is the fact that it
makes us frown again about
these problems, rather than
sense that we're on the way
( happily led by Faulkner, the
Master of Form) toward resolving
them.
Intruder in the Dust- though
less violent than most of the
sex- murder and sex- in- murder
novels of Faulkner- bears
many of his
trade labels
( the most obvi-
BOOKS ous of which
are its Southern
locale and the
exhuming of a
body at midnight) .. It is the
story of an adolescent, a maiden
lady( children and women can
act because they believe in
probability, while men must
wait for the facts), the boy's
lawyer uncle who represents
what the boy will become, the
intractable Negro whom all
three of them clear of a false
murder charge and the action of
a lynch mob. Faulkner's mob,
opposing these people of good
will, is overwhelmingly power
ful because its members are not
-seen- they exist primarily as a
symbol of all threat, rather
of one specific horror. than
The texture of the prose in
which Faulkner tells this social
detective story is as dense as the
texture of velvet- and as rich.
Catching the interplay of social
and psychological factors better
American writers
than most
,
Faulkner then sometimes disappoints
us by separating them
again with long sermonizings.
Faulkner's concept of the individual
white man's reaction
( the reaction of the boy and his
uncle) to the Negro problem ---
or, as DuBois has called it, the
Caucasian problem, is in many
ways ideal. Lucas Beauchamp,
the elderly Negro facing the
charge, is a man of pride and
humor and courage. He is a
whole man- a dignified human
being. There is none of the condescending
pity often extended
to his counterparts by so- called
" liberal" writers who
write as if they had graduated often
from a Salvation Army College.
After reaching this warm
honesty, however, Faulkner
then would take Lucas- along
with the white man- outside of
the mainstream of man. Individualism
runs riot in the uncle
lawyer- spokesman's contention
that" No... I only say that the
injustice is ours, the South's. We
must expiate it( in the way of
guilt- individualized moderns?)
ourselves." Faulkner would include
Lucas without reservation
among the white southerners,
but the totality means to him a
" homogeneity" which must
fight against interference from
the North, against action by a
federal government.
The main contradiction of Intruder
in the Dust- and a determining
one- is that Faulkner
can, in the manner of Joyce and
Proust, project a regional set
ting into a world meaning while
failing to realize that a regional
problem( the problem of the
Beauchamps who do not usually
have the luck to meet up with
these" one and two halves") can
be solved only by relatively universal
means. By the action of a
federal FEPC law, by the action
a fighting Progressive Party,
of to be concrete.
