STRUNG UP.
A Negro Is Lynched at Asheville for Kill
ing a White Man.
A special to the State Chronicle from
Asheville says: Fred Tyler, white, an engineer
on the Western North Carolina
railroad, and Hezekiah Rankin, colored,
became involved in an altercation at the
round house here last night, during which
Tyler struck Rankin with a lump of coal.
Rankin ran off to secure a physician, and,
coming back, fired at Tyler, the bullet
striking him in the abdomen. A crowd
of railroad men caught Rankin, and, tak
ing him across the river, hung him to a
tree. His was found this morning.
Tyler will die body.
