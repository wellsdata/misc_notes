THREE NEGROES LYNCHED.
PROCTOR, W. Va., May 2.- The bodies of
three negroes, brothers, named Sylvester,
were found hanging to a tree on the road-
side six miles east of here yesterday. Each
bore a placard on which was written:
" Nigger thievery must be broken up."
The farmers in the neighborhood have suffered
depredations at the hands of un
known persons, and it seems that they
finally settled on the Sylvesters as the
guilty ones, as they lived comparatively
yet scarcely ever did any work.
comfortably No arrests have been made.
