CAUSE OF THE RIOT.
Two Brutal Murders Charged to Engineer
Hawes Sought to Be Avenged.
BIRMINGHAM, Dec. 11.- Last Tuesday
the body of a little girl was found in
East lake, near this city. The fact was
established that she had been murdered,
and Wednesday the body was identified
as that of May Hawes, the daughter of
R. R. Hawes, a railroad engineer. Circumstances
pointed to the girl's father
as her murderer. He was married in
Columbus, Miss., Wednesday
though supposed to have a wife evening here.
On his arrival here with his bride
that night he was arrested, chrrged
with murder. Then it was learned
that he had never been divorced
from his first wife and that she
had been missing since last Saturday
as well as a younger child. Search
for the woman's body commenced at
once, and soon additional circumstantial
evidence against Hawes was secured.
Saturday evening the body of his wife
was found at the bottom of the lake
weighted down with iron. This caused
intense excitement throughout the city,
and that night fifty or more officers were
placed around the jail armed with Win
chester rifles, anticipating a possible at
tempt to lynch Hawes. About 11 o'clock
Saturday night about 2,000 or 3,000 men
gathered in the vicinity of the jail mak
ing threats. They were without organi-
zation or leaders. and after much parley-
ing with the mayor and others who tried
to get them to the
go away
crowds finally reached the end of a
narrow alleyway leading to the jail
doors. Then the officers warned them
to stand back or they would be fired on.
After repeated warnings they would not
stand back, and Sheriff Smith ordered
the officers to fire. One volley was fired
and twenty- three men fell killed or
wounded. Three men were instantly
killed, seven have since died, and ten
others are badly wounded. The mob
then hurriedly escaped, vowing

THE SHERIFF'S STATEMENT.
Ho Says the Mob Fired the First and Last
Shots in the Affray.
Sheriff Smith says:" We begged and
pleaded with the crowd to keep back and
then they fired the first shots. Several
shots were fired by the crowd before I
gave the order to fire. We begged them
to halt at the mouth of the alley and
still they kept coming on. We begged
them to go back time and again, and
again warned them we would shoot, but
they would not listen to us. They came
half way up the alley chose to the jail
door and were shouting Blow up the
jail with dynamite. Ater all this, and
after they opened fire, I gave the order
to fire. They continued firing after we
ceased. I feel that we could not have
done anything else under the circumstances
, and I deeply regret the necessity
