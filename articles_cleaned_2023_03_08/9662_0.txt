THE indictment in Newark, Ohio, of
fifteen persons for participation in the
lynching of Carl Etherington, an officer
of the Anti- Saloon league, probably
marks a turning of the tide in popular
complacency toward mob violence.
The governor of Ohio and the legal
authorities in Licking county have
shown every disposition to treat the
murderers of Etherington just like
any other murders. The mayor of
Newark acted the
on once widely prevalent
view that citizens bent on taking
the law into their own hands
should not be unduly interfered with.
He did nothing to quell the rioting
which preceded the lynching, and
Governor Harmon removed him from
office for negligence. Now the courts
are to try the lynchers as common
murderers, ignoring the usual pretence
that they were acting as a sort of
vigilance committee, merely
ing the formal operations of anticipat- justice.
