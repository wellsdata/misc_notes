Begged Them Not to Lynch Her Assailant.
LEBANON, Ky .. Nov. 8.- Will Bean, the negro
who assaulted the wife of L. C. Clark in this
county on last Thursday, was captured and
placed in jail here this morning. While the
Sheriff was bringing him to town a mob took
him before Mrs. Clark, who identified him. She
is expected to die from fright, but she pleaded
with the mob to allow the law to take its course,
and Bean was finally turned over to the Sheriff.
Negroes as well whites threaten to lynch
him if Mrs. Clark dies as.
