The recent murder of a good and
splendi! citizen in Oklahoma City and
the subsequent lynching of his slayer
has been the occasion of much discussion
on the part of citizens, and
editorial comment on the part of the
newspaper reporters as to the cause
leading to the lynching and the
ponsibility back of it. Now that sufficient
time has intervened to permit
men of intelligence to study soberly
the question, it is well that a state
ment of actual conditions in Oklahoma
be made that the people may form
their own conclusions as to whether
or not the attitude of the chief ex
ecutive, on the question of capital
punishment, had anything whatever
to do either with the murder or of
the subsequent lynching.
I shall not attempt to enter into a
discussion of the right or wrong of
capital punishment. In this statement
I shall confine myself entirely to the
expediency of capital punishment as
a means of preventing crime. I shall
also confine myself to conditions in
Oklahoma, for it is here that we are
wrestling with the problem and the
erities would be quick to say that it
is unfair to cite conditions in other
states or to bring forward statistics
gathered from other communities as
a justification for assuming any giv
en position on this subject in Oklahoma
.
i assert, first, that capital punish
ment for crime does not tend to de
crease the number of crimes against
which that punishment is directed:
second, that the commuting of death
sentences to life imprisonment does
not tend to increase mob violence,
and the record in Oklahoma justifies
both assertions.
The statistics gathered show that
for five years, from January 1, 1909,
to Dec. 31, 1913, eighteen persons met
their death through mob violence in
Oklahoma This record is made up as
fellows: 1909, five; 1910, one; 1911,
eight; 1912, none, 1913, four.
The first commutation from death
to life imprisonment was executed by
on the 28th day of July, 1911;

REPLIES TO CRITICS
CAPITAL PUNISHMENT
been given by me as governor of
the state that would lead any man to
suppose that I opposed legal executions
. On the contrary, every citizen
of the state had the right to assume
that I was not opposed to legal executions
for the reason that in January
or February, 1911, soon after my in-
resduction into office. I permitted a legal
execution to take place in Tulsa
County. So that my position on the
question of capital punishment could
by no stretch of the imagination or
misrepresentation of facts, have had
anything to do with the number of
homicides committed or the number
of lynchings that ensued prior to
July 28, 1911.
Of the eight persons killed by mobs
in 1911, at least three, and possibly
more( I have not yet the exact figures
), were killed prior to July 28,
1911, so that the record, assuming
that only three were killed prior to
July 1, would stand as follows: The
number killed by mobs in the two
and a half years prior to July 1, 1911,
nine; the number killed in the two
and a half years subsequent to that
date nine It would be well also to
,.
note that of those killed prior to July
1, 1911, the entire number was charger
with murder and under our laws
could have been legally executed; that
of the nine lynchings since that date,
three of them were charged with
criminal assault- an offense for
which a legal execution could not
have taken place.
What relation has the commutation
of death sentence to mob vicience? --
let us see. The commutation of death
sentences to life imprisonment for the
ive years as shown by the record
discloses the following: The year of
1909, one, 1910, three, 1911, one, 1912
eighth 1913 three Tabulating these
figures it will be seen that during the
last two years of my predecessor's
term of office he commuted four death
sentences to life imprisonment. The
year in which he commuted one there
were five persons lynched; the year
he commuted three, there was one
person lynched. In my administra
it shows that during the year
1911, when only one commutation
was issued, and that on July 28, after
more than half of the year had passed.
there were eight persons killed by
mobs; while in the year 1912 when
eight commutations were issued, there
was not a single case of mob violence
. In other words, both during
Governor Haskell's administration
and mine the year in which the great
est number of commutations were is
sued, the fewest number of mob violence
occurred, while in the years in
which the fewest commutations were
executed, the largest number of per
sons were killed by mob violence.
Upon the other question of the relation
of capital punishment to the
commission of criminal homicides, I
have gathered with care statistics in
this state for the years 1910, 1911,
1912 and 1913, with the following result
: In 1910 there were committed
in the state of Oklahoma 243 homicides
. in 1911, 228, in 1912, 209. The
report for 1913, with twelve counties
yet to report, shows the number of
homicides in the counties heard from
to have been 171. The same counties
for the year 1912, reported 171, so
that the record stands exactly
same number of homicides in 1913 the
as in 1912 among the same counties.
During the years of 1910 and 1911, or
at least until the 28th day of July,
1911, legal executions were permit
ted in Oklahoma; during the years
of 1912 1913, no legal executions
have taken and place, and yet these fig
ures disclose the fact that during the
two latter years there was a very
material decrease in the number of
homicides committed as compared
with the two preceding years.
It is unnecessary to comment upon
these figures. To anyone of ordinary
inteligence they interpret themselves,
and answer conclusively the theories
and conclusions of those who dis
cuss the question without informing
themselves as to conditions and facts.
The position I have taken is that
capital punishment as a deterrent for
the crime of murder is neither effect
ive nor wise. I believe, however, that
men rightfully convicted of the crime
of murder should be made to spend
the remainder of their lives in the
penitentiary, and I have acted upon
this theory. While I have granted
twelve commutations of death sentences
to life imprisonment during
my three years of administration, I
have only issued one parole to a man
serving a life sentence for murder,
and that was in the case of a young
man committed from Pottawatomie
county, in which the judge, prosecuting
attorney and jury engaged in the
trial and conviction of the defendant
all petitioned me to parole upon the
ground that the defendant should not
have been convicted in the first place.
During the two years imediately
preceding my induction into office,
seventeen persons serving life sentences
were liberated on parole. Se
the record stands for three years of
my administration twelve commuta-
tions of death sentences to life imprisonment
, one parole of a life pris
oner for murder, while in the two
years immediately preceding me, the
record is four commutations of death
sentences to life imprisonment, and
seventeen paroles of life prisoners
charged with murder.
I do not cite these facts as any
criticism of the former administration
, nor as a justification of what I
have done, but simply as an evidence
of the fact that the criticism that has
been leveled against me, is not the
cutgrowth of honest conviction, but
that it is personal in its character
and not directed at the principle involved
. No such criticism was vis
ited upon former governors, and yet
to me society has much more to fear
from the liberation of a murdere
serving a life sentence, than it has
to fear from the confinement for the
rest of his life of a murderer who has
been sentenced to death.
It seems that some men cannot
understand that the governor of the
state is supposed to be the governor
of all of the people. As the governor
it is my duty in the enforcement
of the law to see that law is en-
forced against all men with equal
fairness and justice. In 1912 sixty
committed homicides in Ok
iegroes-
lahoma, 120 white men were charged
with the same offense. During my
of office I have only had to
term
commute the death sentence of one
white man, while I have commuted
the death sentences of eleven negroes
. Though twice as many white
men committed murder as negroes,
in the administration of our law wa
undertake to hang eleven times as
many negroes as whites for the same
offense. If this be a fair administration
justice and of right, then my
ideas of of justice are terribly pervert
ed. Had I permitted the hanging of
those eleven negroes, and commuted
the death sentence of the white man,
and followed that by releasing on pa
role from the penitentiary half of the
murderers there serving life terms,
there would have been little criticism
of my conduct by those who
now discover so much to find fault
with.
It is not an uncommon thing to
find among those who cry out against
the commuting of death sentences to
life imprisonment many who
are
ready to sign petitions importuning
the governor to grant paroles and parlic
dons to men serving life sentencesly
for murder.
It has been said by some of the editors
that I should permit legal executions
in order to prevent lynchings
in other words, to appease the nob,
yet every man who assists as a mem
ber of a mob in the hanging of an individual
, no matter what crime may
have been committed, is, under the
law guilty of murder and if the law
should be enforced against these individuals
, every one of them would
have to be electrocuted or sent to
the penitentiary for life. How many
of these critics and editors would be
willing to see the members of the
mob that recently hanged the negro
in Cleveland county, either electrocuted
or sent to the penitentiary for
life? And this is what would re
yet-
,
sult, were the law of Oklahoma enforced
."
In this entire matter I am doing
what I think it is my duty to do. I
am not trying to please the mob, and
I shall never be swerved from the
path of duty nor hesitate in my efforts
to bring about a better condition
of law observance in Oklahoma in order
to satisfy the demands of a mob
or the clamor of that class of our
citizenship which yet derives its in-
spiration of what is right in govern
ment from the old doctrine of" an
eye for an eye and a tooth for
tooth." Placarding the slain victim
with inscriptions to the governor may
tend to ease the conscience of those
who under our law have made them
selves murderers, but it will not in
the least disturb me, nor have effect
my future course in dealing with these
vital problems of government.
One of the critics, while condemn
ing my polisy of commuting death
sentences, makes this remarkable admission
: The time will ultimately
come when all civilized nations will
the
abolish capital punishment, but
time when this can safely be done has
not yet arrived in Oklahoma." What
a terrible arraignment of the citizenship
of this young state, not yet civilized
! Editorials like this do more
to discredit the citizenship and civilization
of this state in the eyes of
the world than do all the commuta-
tions that could be executed in a
hundred years. Oklahoma IS civilized
, as much so as any other people
in the world, and if we have not yet
advanced to that degree of civilization
where capital punishment can
be abolished with safety, we will nev
er be civilized to that extent. Murdering
, either under the guise of the
law or through mob violence, has
never yet tended to lift a people indulging
in it to a higher piane of civ
tization, and the record as disclosed
above, shows that in Oklahoma civilization
quickly responds to every ef
fort made in the interest of humani
In passing let me say that seven
ty- five per cent of the homicides committed
Oklahoma ,, according to
the record in is due to the fact that the
prohibition and gambling laws are be
ing violated. If these mobs that cry
for human blood, and editors that
write daily and weekly lectures to
the governor about law enforcement,
from Oklahoma the botlegger and
would interest themselves in driving
from Oklahoma the bootlegger and
the gambler, we would have fewer
good citizens killed by irresponsible
criminals, such as occurred in Oklahoma
City recently, and there would
be no occasions either for legal or
executions. But when the effort
is mob made to enact laws that would
make it possible to enforce Oklaho
ma's criminal statutes, these same
people are quick to come to a defense
of the gambler and the bootlegger by
arguing that the passage of such laws
would be giving to the governor of
the state" autocratic power" which
might be abused, and thus is the argument
made effective which perpetuates
conditions, while the enemies of
society and good government continue
to prey upon the people and lay the
foundation stone upon which murder
and mob violence erect their structure
.
In conclusion I have no hesitancy
in stating that inflamamtory editorials
that arouse the brutal passions
and natures of men are a hundred
times more responsible for mob violence
in this state, than any attitude
the governor has assumed upon the
question of capital punishment
