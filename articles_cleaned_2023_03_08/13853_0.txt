MOB LYNCHES TWO NEGROES.
They Had Confessed to Taking Part in
Murderous Raid on Italians.
NEW ORLEANS, March 15.- Clint Farris
and Henry Gardner, negroes, were lynched
at Monroe, La., early to- day for connection
with the murders and other crimes recently
committed in that vicinity.
The negroes confessed to killing two
Italians, Frank Lombardo and Joseph
Dallio, in a negro raid on fruit stores. They
implicated a third negro, who has not yet
been caught. Since the attack on the
Italians public sentiment in Monroe has
been roused to a high state of excitement
by a negro's attempt to outrage a white
woman and by attacks on white men at
night.
The two negroes were captured late in
the evening on suspicion. They confessed
and shortly after midnight a mob of fifty
men gathered in the court house square.
The mob leaders demanded the keys of the
jail, and failing to get them broke into the
prison, took out the prisoners and lynched
them in the square. On the bodies of the
lynched negroes were found this morning
the sign: Bad negroes not wanted in
Monroe."'
