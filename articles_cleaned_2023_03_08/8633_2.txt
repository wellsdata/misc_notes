WIFT PUNISHMENT.
Two Notorious Cattle Thieves
Lynched.
DENVER, Col., July 22.- A Cheyenne,
Wyo., special says: A telegram received
to- day announced the lynching at Sweet
water of Jim Averill and a woman who
lived with him as his wife. Averill was
postmaster at Sweetwater, which consists
simply of a station contiguous to a number
of ranches. Averill drifted into the Sweet-
water country four years ago and at once
took up a government claim. He was soon
joined by a woman, who took up a claim
adjoining the town of Bortwell. Both
were recognized as hard citizens. The
woman was one of the most daring riders
in the country. She rode man- fashion the
most vicious brutes, and in ropeing cattle
could hold her place with the average cow
boy. For some time both have been under
suspicion, as they have rapidly been accumulating
a fortune. As they came to the
country without anything this was regarded
as evidence against them Recently
.
they turned loose twenty- five freshly
branded calves, which completely satisfied
their neighbors that they were mavericking
This was the particular act that led to the
lynching. From the particulars received
is known that a body of masked men succeeded
in getting on their trail. They
were captured after a struggle and, after
being bound, were led some distance away
and together strung up to the limb of a
tree and their bodies were riddled with
bullets. This is the fifth hanging that has
taken place in the same section since
spring. last
