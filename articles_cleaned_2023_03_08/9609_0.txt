a colored man who left his South Caro
lina home to become a barber in an
Ilinois city. Not long afterward&
negro was lynched in this town, and
fears of a" race riot" were entertained.
A customer entering the shop found
the barber packing up his tools, and
learned that he proposed to return
South Carolina. to
" There is too much lynchin' goin'
in these
on parts," declared he.
"" Tain't safe round hyar."
" Well," replied the customer," don't
you know there are just as many
lynchings down South as there are

" Yes, sir, I' spects dat's true," was
the reply," but if I's lynched hyar I
dunno who's gwine do it, but if Ts
lynched down dar, I knows I's
be lynched by my friends." gwine
