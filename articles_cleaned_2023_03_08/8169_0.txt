LASHES INSTEAD OF A HANGING.
Judge Lynch Reconsiders a sentence
on a Negro Highwayman.
INDIANAPOLIS, April 28.- The suburb of
Houghville has long been terrorized by a
gang of toughs. Early this morning a mob
of 100 citizens broke into the jail and took
out John Abbott, colored, arrested for high
way robbery, placed a rope around his neck
and dragged him to the woods a mile west of
town.
After he had been strung up, cooler counsels
prevailed and he was cut down, tied to a
tree and punished by fifty lashes on his bare
back. He was taken to jail after confessing
his guilt.
The citizens then ordered all worthless
negroes to leave town.
About 4 o'clock this morning a score of
negroes from Bucktown drove to Hough-
ville to release the negroes in jail, but they
were met by citizens, who, with
Winchesters, persuaded them to return loaded.
