ERASING LYNCHING
Head of Tuskegee Institute
Credits Drop tc Growth of
Merciful Attitude.
By the Associated Press.
TUSKEGEE, Ala., February 20.
Dr. F. D. Patterson, president of
Tuskegee Institute, today credited a
90 per cent decrease in lynchings in
the United States since 1887 to
" growth in the humanitarian attitude
of the American people."
A tabulation of lynchings by decades
, from the institute's department
of records and research, listed 1,583
mob victims in the 1887-96 period,
and 151 in the 1927-36 period.
Each decade since the first revealed
a decline in mob action. Lynchings
totaled 1,030 for the decade begin
ning in 1897; 670 for that beginning
in 1907, and 463 for the
period. 1917-1926
Dr. Patterson listed three major
factors as contributing to the decline.
The first, he said, is the tendency for
frontier characteristics in the South
to disappear; second, the breaking
down of isolation in the South by in
creased communciation facilities, and
third, increasing agitation within the
South" against lynchings."
