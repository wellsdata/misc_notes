A Constitutional Question.
The lynching of a negro by a negro
mob has caused some of the southern
editors to put on their thinking caps.
In this especial case the carefulness of
the mob is commended, for there was
not a particle of doubt but the
that
guilty one was executed. On the
whole, the mob seems to have been
much above the average, as far as con
duct and carefulness were concerned.
" But," says one of the editors," what
will it lead to? Can ignorant and ir
responsible negroes be permitted or
entrusted to enforce mob
law? Can
any man argue himself into the belief
that it is safe to allow them to form
mobs to break in jails and
, overpower
Sheriffs?"
Now these questions are not hard to
answer. Of course, mobs made up of
negroes should not be permitted to
carry out their designs, no matter how
" orderly" the mob may be. It is
wrong, whether it happens down South
or in Ohio. It should be stopped, and
we hope to hear no more of mobs
made up of negroes.
But, come to think of it, there should
be no discrimination on account of
color, race or previous condition of
servitude. There is a enstitutional
amendments that covers the case, and
we are bound to say that it covers
white as well as black The safest way
.
out of it all is to condemn the whole
business and thus obey the constitution
of the land and the laws thereof
