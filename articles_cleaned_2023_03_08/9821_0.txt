NEGRO IS LYNCHED
IN MCCOMB BY MOB
Body Found on Edge of Town
-Had Had Trouble With
White Man.
The Magnolia Gazette of Thursday
records the lynching of a young ne-
gro, Eddie McDowell, who was taken
from his home in the heart of the
residential section of McComb and
done to death by a mob.
The Gazette says:
About two months ago, while employed
in the garage of the Caston
Motor Company, he got on a drunk
en spree, and, while in that state,
applied profane epithets to a white
employe of the same who
concern,
promptly knocked him down. The
white men of the garage it is said,
attempted to keep the negro off the
streets, knowing that he would be
arrested, but he resisted their efforts
and went out. Later, he returned to
the garage armed with a pistol,
whereupon Chief of Police L. Joe
Quin was called and placed him under
arrest.
The next day the negro was
before Police Justice Wolbrecht tried on a
charge of carrying concealed wea
pons and punished with a fine of
$ 250 and 30 days imprisonment, the
latter involving hard labor on the
streets.
The negro worked 29 days of his
sentence on the streets, when, it is
said, his fine was reduced to$ 50, and
on its payment, he was released.
Since then he had made a trip to
Hot Springs as the driver of Mr.
Wm. McColgan's car, and, on his
return, was employed as chauffeur by
Dr. Dickerson.
He was about 25 years old, and
unmarried.
The lynching, which by the boldness
and secrecy with which it was
carried out, surpasses anything of
the kind ever known in this section,
occurred between the hours of 2:00
and 2:30 o'clock Monday morning,
but it was not until daylight following
that the commission of the crime
became known by the discovery of
the negro's body lying beside the
road.
As soon as he was notified of the
finding of the body, Sheriff Leg-
gett called Coroner L. G. Quin, and
a jury of inquest was impanelled.
The jury spent several hours making
an investigation of the homicide,
but was unable to procure any sort
of evidence which would give a clue
to the identity of the persons respon-
elble for the negro's fate, and a verdict
was returned accordingly of
death at the hands of parties
known. un-
