Nothing could illustrate more pain
fully the evil effect of lynch law than
the terrible story of the lynching of Mr.
Wright, of Maryland, and his attendant,
while traveling in Colorado, by a gang
of desperadoes representing themselves
as vigilants. It appears that Mr. Wright,
who was a practicing attorney in Washington
, and a young man of bright
promise, visited Colorado in the interest
of a nt, and while there purchased
several mules, and, with his attendant,
started off to visit some mining property
he had The mules had been
stolen, but of this fact Mr. Wright was
ignorant. He was pursued by the vigilance
committee, and, without being
permitted to explain his possession of
the stock, was ignominiously hanged
like a felon the band of ruffians.
His attendant shared the same fate. The
outrage is one of the boldest that has
been recorded for a long time, and it is
to be hoped that the desperadoes may be
for their horrible crime, but of
punished this there is little probability.
