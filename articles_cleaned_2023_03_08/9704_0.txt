Versus
Lynch
By Judge RICHARD MARKLEY
Two gentlemen of Four Aces, a min
ing town, were consulting as to how
to get rid of an enemy. One demurred
at shooting since a court had been established
.
" You see, Jim," he said," they'll keep
us in jail forever waitin' to try us."
" Don't you worry about that, Pete,"
said the other." This yere

So they shot their man and stood
trial.
The citizens of Four Aces, eager to
try the new legal system that had been
introduced, did not inconvenience the
two criminals at all by delay. The
murder was committed in the morning,
and by 3 o'clock in the afternoon the
trial commenced. A limb of the law
named Simpson was prosecuting attorney
, and one Waterman was assigned
by the court to defend the accused.
To save time they were tried together.
The first hour was occupied in fencing
between the prosecutor and counsel for
the defense, the latter claiming

Then the prosecutor summoned wit

There were several other persons in
the room at the time of the crime, but
counsel for defense proved that the
eyesight of one was bad, that another
was so deaf that he couldn't hear a
cannon fired, to say nothing of a re

at a table in a jog in the room where
he could not see the group in question.
Friends of the accused swore that
had known them for years, both they had
taught Sunday school and neither had
ever carried a revolver- indeed, they
would not know how to handle such a
weapon.
The prosecutor endeavored to impeach
the veracity of these witnesses,
but when he called on citizens present
to swear that they wouldn't believe

Every witness held up a hand.
" That'll do," said Mr. Budd; then,
turning to the large number of spec-
rators present, he added:
" Citizens of Four Aces, you have
seen a trial by court methods and a
trial by Lynch methods. All who are

A dead silence followed.

There was a roar of" Ayes" that
struck terror into the accused men.

Ten minutes later two forms were
