FIFTEENTH INSTALLMENT
Gordon Barclay's servants had or
ders to admit no one without orders.
The city was in a turmoil. With each
fresh edition of the newspapers the
situation of the conspirators became
more serious.
In the public parks
effigies of them were hanged or
burned. It became necessary to keep
a cordon of â€¢ police aboyt Barclay's
house. In Semmes' house and Sturte
vant's no window remained whole. For
twenty hours these two men had been
Barclay's guests.
Gunsdorf's great hour had come
that hour for which he had plotted
all his life, and lied for and schemed
for. He had been the leading figure
in the mob that had tried to lynch
the triumvirate in the first burst of
rage. And he found himself suddenly
at the head of all the lawless ele
ments in the city. He was drunk
with power and a sense of his own
importance. But openly he spoke of
his love for mankind.
Through a man friendly to him and
deep in Gunsdorf's councils, Tommy
learned that the life of the man who
had adopted him and been good to him
was in danger. His house was to be
stormed over the heads of the po
lice, and himself hanged or torn to
pieces, as might happen.
All their differences fled from
Tommy's mind, and he remembered
only their mutual affection; so he hur
ried to the old familiar house and was
presently admitted.
" It's just to say a few words," said
Tommy, and he told Barclay what
Gunsdorf was planning for that very
day.
" We'll go to Gull Island," Barclay
said simply," till this thing has blown
over. I suppose you are not unhappy
about what happened. It's a pity
she came back has. Tommy, when
we quarreled I was ambitious for power
only. Later I began to think that Ce
lestia was a real panacea for a sick
world. So that if I had been destined
to rule, I would have ruled for the
good of the people. I want you to
know that what began in cynicism
ended in faith and honesty. I have
put you back in my will for practically
everything I possess. Carlton Fitch
has turned knave. Mary, if she marries
him, will be worthy of him."
" You'll need somebody to keep
house for you at Gull Island," said
Tommy. He was too moved to refer
" I 11

get Celestia there as quickly as I
can."
" Have you married her?"
Tommy looked very manly when he
said that he had. And Barclay smiled
one of his old- time dazzling smiles.
" And I think," he said finally," that
you had better get out of this house
as quickly as you can. I'm going, too.
I can't afford to be a hero."
They shook hands and parted, never
to meet in this life again.
Late that night Tommy and Celestia
and Freddie the Ferret, whom Tommy
was trying to train to be his valet,
caught the last boat for Bartell's, on
Bartell's Island, from which Gull's Is
land may be reached in an hour in a
fast launch. They had had no word
of what had happened in New York.
Tommy, without arousing suspicion,
could not find out if Barclay, Semmes
and Sturtevant had gone on ahead,
or were following ..
" If they are behind us," he said to
Celestia," they'll have to charter something
. Perhaps father will come all
the way by boat- that would be best.
His own yacht would be spotted. But
he'll work
something."
Gull Island resembles a loaf of
bread that has risen too much. A
rounded, billowing top is set upon
high, almost sides.
In this island perpendicular retreat. open and
