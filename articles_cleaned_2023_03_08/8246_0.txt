A COLORED FIEND.
A Jealous Husband Murders his
Wife at Pocatello.
Alec Woods, a big burly colored
barber living at Pocatello, on Saturday
last applied at a drug store
there for a mixture of poison, which
was refused him as the person in
attendance at the store surmised
that the drug was not wanted for

months past Woods has had trouble
with his wife who is represented as
being more than ordinary attractive
, and in no wise loth to raise
the jealous ire of her heavy weight
spouse. Last January she left him
and went to Portland, Oregon, but
the husband started after her and
induced her to return to Pocatello.
On last Sunday Woods was miss
ing from Pocatello as were two
valuable horses from a ranch near
by and the last seen horseback in
on
company with an Indian near the
town of Oxford. His wife was also
missing was at once
aroused that she had been fouly
dealt with by her husband. So
firm was this suspicion that a re
ward of$ 500 was offered for im
formation of her whereabouts, and
very every
on reservation was in
the search which was continued un
til Tuesday when the dead body of
the woman was found in a clump
of bushes about a mile from town.
The skull of the unfortunate wo
man had been crushed by some
blunt weapon and the other
wise mutilated in a horrible man
ner. But one opinion prevailed as
to how the woman had met her
death- by the hands of her brutal
husband- and no time was lost to
ensure his capture. The direction
in which he was going when last
seen on Sunday near Oxford led to
the belief that he would make for
the railroad as rapidly as possible
and the surmise was correct. An
account of the murder and a full
description of the murderer was at
once telegraphed in all directions,
and on Tuesday night word was
received that Woods had been captured
at Corinne, Utah. It was expected
that he would have been
brought back for delivery to the
Idaho authorities, and had he been
he would have been given a short
shift by the incensed people of Po-
catello. Judge Lynch would have
claimed him and meted out to him
the penalty richly deserved. Anticipating
such action, the wife
murderer was not taken to Poca
tello as first intended, but will
probably be brought to Blackfoot,
and securely guarded until the
excitement over the murder has in
a measure died out. Woods is
well known on Wood River and
has a brother, also a barber,
Shoshone. at
