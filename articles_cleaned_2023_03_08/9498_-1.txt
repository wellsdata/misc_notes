GOV. ATKINSON ON LYNCHING.
His Recommendations to the Georgia
Assembly- Saye Arm the Prisoner.
Atlanta, Ga., Oct. 27.- Mob law was
severely condemned by Governor Atkin
Son in his message to the Georgia Legislature
here to- day. The message bris-
tled with a scorching and sensational at
tack upon the lawless spirit that fosters
the lynch law in this State.
He says that to exterminate the practice
of Inching, the crime must be made
odious and shameful. He advocates
stringent legislation against the mobs
and insists that the Legislature pass a
law making every county
a crime is committed subject to a large
indemnity to the relatives of the mob's
victim.
The Governor is in favor of arming
the prisoners and allowing them to protect
themselves from mohs, He says:
" The arresting officer is clothed with
authority to take the life of the assail-
ants when resisting their efforts to take
a prisoner from his custody, and it is his
duty to take life if necessary to protect
the prisoner and retain him in custody.
This he should be required to do at
the hazard âœ” his own life, or the prisoner
should be unshackled, armed and given
an opportunity to defend himself. The
knowledge on the part of the mob that
this would be done would deter it from
pursuing its lawless purpose, and the
law would permitted to protect the
innocent and be punish the guilty."
