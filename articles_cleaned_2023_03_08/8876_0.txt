Swear Death to Blacks.
Trouble arose over the killing of James
Stockton by Duckett. Just prior to the
lynching of Duckett the negroes had planned
to inaugurate a race war. Duckett was the
leader, and at his death the negroes let the
matter out and the citizens became
greatly
enraged. Another negro named Joe King
remarked that Stockton should have been
murdered sooner. He was taken to the
woods and whipped, as was also John John
son. Other negroes made threats, but noth
ing occurred until yesterday, when the dead
body of Goodwin was found hanging to a
tree just across Red river from the Stockton
farm, in Bowie county, Texas. He formerly
worked for Stockton and was chased across
Mud creek.
The place where the trouble occurred is
several miles from any town of communication
and it is difficult to obtain details, as
the people are very reluctant about giving
out the news. A justice of the peace went
to where Goodwin was hanged.

JACKSON, Miss., March 23.- Three
negroes were taken from an officer of the

a race encounter on the Midnight plantation
early last week. They were arrested and
taken to Yazoo City and held in jail. The
constable boarded the steamer Rescue with
the negroes Saturday morning and reached
Silver City with them. All that is further
known is that the negroes fell into the
hands of the mob at this
point were shot

to death and thrown into the river, as above
stated. The feeling
against these negroes
had been very bitter on account of a disturbance

week, in which they, with two other negroes,
had fired upon two whites upon the
road. public
