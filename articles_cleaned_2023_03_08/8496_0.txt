A DOOMED ORCHARD.- The Detroit Free
Press of the 27th says:" Some time last
summer a large and very thrifty peach or
chard owned by Martin Green, near the
town of Benton Harbor, in this state, was
almost destroyed one night by girdling, the
villains endeavoring to make sure work by
injuring the trees so that further life seem
ed impossible. The next day the citizens
of the town turned out en masse and, by
the aid of salves and rags, saved the major,
ity of the trees, so that they bloomed and
bore a large crop of fruit. Scarce had the
fruit been gathered, when the fiends went
at their work again this time more thorough
Iy, but again the citizens turned out and
a of
section of the country was highly excited,
rewards were offered for the perpetratore,
sheriffs hunted for the wretches, but all
was in vain. Some little time ago, Mr.
Martin sold out, believing that he had contracted
the autipathy of some of his neigh
bors, although he was known as a mild,
quiet man, and a good citizen. His place
was purchased by a Mr. Hunter, of Chicago
but the change of proprietors did not stop
the work of destruction, three hundred of
the best trees being girdled anew on last
Saturday night wesk. The citizens are
now brought up to that pitch that will result
in lynch law if the dastards are discovered
, although there seems to be at
little chance of unearthing the scoundrels present.'
