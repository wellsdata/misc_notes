MOB VIOLENCE.
Several days ago two negroes who had
been convicted of murder were lynched in
Bullock county, and the AGE- HERALD
severely condemned the lawless act at the
time. A similar outbreak of the mob
spirit has just taken place near Memphis.
Six negroes charged with barn burning
were riddled with bullets. The lawless
spirit which finds its vent in a lynching
seems on the increase instead of decrease.
It is the great danger which threatens our
institutions. There is no limit to the excess
of the mob spirit when it once breaks
loose. The innocent is as apt to suffer as
the guilty. It may be directed toward
wealth, instead of toward crime.
Already have we seen in this country a
display of animosity toward corporations
and toward rich men and for no other
reason than because, of their wealth.
Every man is deeply interested in putting
down the mob spirit, for he knows not but
that he may be the next victim. So open
have men become in deflance of law that
they engage in a lynching without even
to conceal their
taking the precaution
faces. This shows a most deplorable and
dangerous disregard for the majesty of the
law. This indicates that public opinion is
often on the side of the lynchers. This
must not be- the people must condemn
such acts. The constitution guarantees
every man protection to life, liberty and
property, but how can this protection be
maintained when men take the law in
their own hands. Lynch law leads to an
archy, and anarchy to overthrow of all
government. The press, pulpit and all
moral agencies cannot too severely con
demn mob and warn the people agains:
its legitimate law results.
