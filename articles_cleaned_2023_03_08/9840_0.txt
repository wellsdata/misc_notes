Governor Adams. In response to a tele
gram from the New York World asking his
views upon the recent Ohio lynching, sald:
" Lynch law never justifiable. If legal penalty
for crime was infallible there would be
no lynchings. To make punishments more
certain and terrible, capital punishment
should be abolished, murder and rape punishable
by life imprisonment, and pardon
power over life sentences taken from the
executive. Conviction for capital
crime is
often prevented by prejudice or sentiment
against taking life by law, there being few
juries upon which there are not members
opposed to death penalty. Eliminate capital
punishment, deny pardon and you insure
certain conviction. Destroy the Incentive
to lynch, and inspire in criminal a ten fold
greater fear of the law than under the pres
ent system, which affords so many oppor.
tunities of evasion and escape. Certain and
speedy punishment for outrageous crimes
the only remedy for lynch law." is
