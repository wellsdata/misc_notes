GORDY'S LAST HOURS.
Condemned Murderer Still in
Jesting Mood.
SHERIFF ANTICIPATES TROUBLE
IT WILL BE
SAYS IF THERE IS
is
THE FAULT OF THE GOVERNOR, of
WHO WOULD NOT HEED HIS RE
QUEST FOR TROOPS.
Georgetown, June 10.- The iynching
of William Andrews, colored, at Prin-"
cess Anne yesterday has had a bad ef-
fect on the people of Georgetown, and
already General White and Sheriff
Johnson are afraid of trouble at the
hanging of James M. Gordy to- morrow. D.
They are not fearful of the people of
Delaware but fear that the crowds of
Maryland people, excited by the work
of yesterday, may not allow the law
to take its course. Sheriff Johnson
has been besieged for
passes
but no strangers got any, as they had
all been given out. The sheriff does not
like the action of Governor Tunnell in
"
declining to send troops to the town.
He was given a fright last night. Ru
mors reached him that Gordy's brothers
, who live in Gumboro hundred, the
home of the murderer, were preparing
to march on the jail with a mob and
take him from the building by force.
The sheriff at once swore in twelve
extra deputies to guard the jail and
posted pickets on all the roads leading
into town. The guards will be kept on
to- night.
The scaffold on which the man will
be hanged was completed yesterday.
Gordy watched the builders as they
worked and jested with them. He said
the structure would look better if it
were whitewashed. He has prepared a
statement to be given to the news
papers on the day he is executed. He
will nct say what it contains, but it
was learned that he does not confess
the murder.
The hanging will take place at 11
o'clock. Obadiah Marvel visited the
jail yesterday in response to a letter
from Gordy and measured him for a
coffin.
GORDY'S LAST HOURS.
Special Dispatch Evening Journal.
Georgetown, June 10-1.30 p. m.
Sheriff Johnson is still apprehensive of
trouble either to- night or to- morrow.
He says he does not expect bloodshed,
but if there is, Governor Tunnell alone
will be responsible. He says the gov-
ernor would not heed his request for
troops. He will put fifty guards on
duty to- night, as he is afraid Gordy's
relatives will agitate a movement to
lynch John Andrews, the eclored turn
key and pardoned wife murderer.
Attorney- General White
fears
trouble within the next twenty- four
hours. He says the feeling is so strong
that there is no telling what will happen
before daylight.
Gordy began his last day on earth
early. He arose at 6 o'clock and ate a
hearty breakfast. He reiterated to his
spiritual adviser his innocence of the
crime, but gave him a long statement
to read from the gallows. He sat at
his window all morning watching the
erection of the scaffold and jesting
with the workmen. He examined the
rope and said he thought it would hold
him.
The man appears to have abiding
faith in the sheriff's ability to protect
him from violence. He asked Sheriff
Johnson not to permit a picture of him
be taken on the scaffold for the sake
of his old mother.
The sheriff drew a jury this
to conduct the hanging. morning
