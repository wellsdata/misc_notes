A MOB OF LYNCHERS DE
FEATED.
PAOLA, KAN., Feb. 12 .-- On Wednesday
night last week, at about 11 o'clock,
Maud Bennings, a colored girl, 9 years
old, was found lying upon the ground
in the suburbs of this city, insensible,
mangled in a terrible manneruised and
evidently
a victim of a fiendish crime. The
child's arms and legs were frozen stiff.
At 11 o'clock on Thursday morning she
became conscious, and told the story of
the treatment she had received: She
had been sent on an errand early in the
evening, and on her return she was
seized by Henry Smith, a notorious ne
gro, carried to a stable, choked and out
raged, and then carried some distance
and thrown into the street, apparently
dead. Smith was arrested and taken to
jail. The child's father, procuring a
shotgun, followed and tried to shoot the
flend, but was prevented by the bystand
anders.
At 11 o'clock on Thursday night an
excited crowd, chiefly of colored men,
some in masks, gathered at the jail and
demanded the prisoner. The Sheriff had
prepared for the emergency, and warned
them away, but the clamorous throng
pushed forward and forced open the
door of the building. The Sheriff struck
the foremost man over the head then
the mob opened fire, to which the Sheriff
and his deputies replied, and a general
fusillade ensued. The front windows
and doors of the building were perforat
heed with shot. Ed. Long, the Sheriff's
son, received a buckshot wound in the
arm. James McGraw, colored, was shot
through the head and instantly killed.
Two other colored men received serious
wounds. Several others were slightly
injured. The mob then retreated, and,
without further effort to obtain posses
sion of the prisoner, dispersed. The
Sheriff was supported by three or
in four
