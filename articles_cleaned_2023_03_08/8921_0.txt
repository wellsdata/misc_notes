Pineapple's Christmas Frolic.
A desire for excitement and blood
was plainly at the bottom of the distressing
and absolutely inexcusable
lynching and conflagration that occur
red at Pineapple on Christmas evening
Even the mob did not claim that their
vietim killed young Melton, who was
shot as a result of crap playing with
negroes. They simply knew that a
negro had been arrested who had per
haps participated in the game of craps.
They did not investigate; they did not
even desire to investigate. They want
ed blood, and they got it in a barbaric
manner, with a conflagration thrown in
that nearly destroyed the town.
This case amply illustrates the beau
ties of lynch law. It demonstrates the
dangers of anarchy. It is a warning to
all the state, and it is a warning that
should not o uaheeded.
If the authorities do not obey public
sentiment in Pineapple itself, and public
decency and the intelligence of
the state, then more of the same sort
may be expected in this state. Pineapple
and Scottsboro furnished the two
lynchings of the year in this state, and
in each punishment should be
meted out case to fit the crime.
