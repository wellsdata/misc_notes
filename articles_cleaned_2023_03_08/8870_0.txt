White Complete and Awful,
Wilmington, Del., June 23.- The excitement
attending the gruesome
tragedy enacted last night outside the
city limits when George White, the ne
gro ravisher and murderer of 17- year
old Helen S. Bishop, was burned at
the stake, has subsided. Public senti
ment appears to deplore the resort to
mob violence, but the consensus of
opinion is that summary vengeance
alone could atone for the brutal outrage
upon the life and honor of the young
girl. It is generally believed that had
the courts brought the murderer to
speedy trial last night's tragedy would
have been averted.
It is not known as yet what action
the state authorities will take. Governor
Hunn says he will confer with Attorney
General H. H. Ward. The lat
ter made a brief statement tonight in
which he said that the state will await
the result of the coroner's inquest and
that every effort would be exerted to
ascertain the names of the leaders.
Coroner McCormick has not fixed the
date for the inquest.
Deputy Coroner Kilmer who today
visiter Price's corner, the scene of the
lynching, found little to show. Ali
semblances of the human form in
White's body had been obliterated by
the avenging fire and the morbid curious
relic hunters. A small portion of
the trunk and one or two charred bones
were recovered and taken to the mor
gue. Of the hundreds of persons who
today visited the spot where the funeral
pyre was lighted scarcely one left
without some ghastly memento. One
man carried away a foot that had not
been consumed. Fragments of clothing,
pieces of wood, cinders and any articles
that bore mute testimony of the mob's
work were eagerly sought.
One arrest was made tonight by State
Detective Francis. The prisoner's name
was not divluged by the police, but it
is said he is charged with having been
a party to the lynching. The police officials
have little to say regarding the
affair It is said that state and
city
.
detectives were in the crowd last night
and recognized some of those who participated
in the burning. Other arrests,
it is believed, will follow.
During the show of resistance made
by the police and jail officials when
the mob attacked the New Castle coun
ty work house, Peter Smith, a 12- year-
old boy, was shot in the back. The
bullet which struck him evidently came
from a pistol in the crowd and it is
claimed by the prison warden that his
guards fired over the heads of the
lynchers. Smith's condition is critical
and he is not expected to live. Another
young man, whose name is unknown.
was slightly injured.
Mrs. Bishop, mother of the murdered
girl, is in a state of nervous excite
ment. White was put to death within
a few hundred yards of the Bishop
home and the glare of the fire and
howls of the mob could be plainly seen
and heard at the house.
JUDGE EXPLAINS COURT'S POSITION
.
Judge Grubb, of the county court, to
day made a public statement in which
he deplores the lynching of White and
its consequent reflection upon the good
name of Delaware. Judge Grubb also
explained the action of the court in re
fusing to call a special session of the
grand jury for the indictment of Miss
Bishop's murderer. He says the trial
would have been attended by such public
clamor and prejudice that a fair
trial would have been impossible, and
the court would have been compelled to
motion of the prisone
grant the
for a change of venue. Once the pris
oner was moved to the insecure jail of
Kent county, or Sussex county, he
might have escaped.
At the county work house today
everything was quiet. Warden Meserve
with his guards was on duty and had
hundreds of callers to whom they re
fused admittance. The large double
doors at the main entrance have been
carried away entirely, and not a vestige
remains.
CLERGYMEN PASS RESOLUTIONS.
Nearly all the clergymen in the city
held a meeting today and passed resolutions
saying:
" We put on record our sense of sor
row, indignation and shame at the lawlessness
and anarchistic demonstration
that has brought reproach upon our
community": and insisting upon the
sanctity of the law and the necessity
for confiding in the integrity of our
courts of justice.
DELAYS OF THE LAW.
Wilmington Del .. June 23.- Rev.
,
Robert A. Elwood, pastor of the Olivet
Presbyterian church, preached a sensational
sermon on the probable lynching
of White last Sunday evening. He
took his text from Corinthians V. 13:
" Therefore put away from among our
selves that wicked person."
After referring to the delay in bring
ing White to a trial Mr. Elwood said:
" Should the murderer of Miss Bishop
be lynched? Yes, but only under one
condition, and that is this- if his trial
shall be delayed until September and
then. though he be proven guilty,
through some technicality of the laws
or any undue influence upon either
judge of jury he be not given capital
punishment, then the citizens of the
state should arise in their might and
execute the criminal and thus uphold
the majesty of the law."
Mr. Elwood said today:
" I am very sorry it happened as it
did. believe the man should have had
a legal I trial, but I also believe that he
appeared greatly distressed today over
the lynching of the negro White. When
pressed for a statement he said:
" There is nothing to Let
say now.
the people become calm once more and
reflect upon what has been done in a
great frenzy of excitement. I shall
fer with the attorney general to see
what course we can take."
It was learned today that the governor
received a telegram at 11:30
o'clock last night from J. Newiin Gaw
throp, president of the trustees of the
New Castle county work house and
David J. Reinhardt, solicitor of the city
of Wilmington. T+ read as follows:
" Call mil√≠tia out at once to protect
work house property. Already entered
by mob of 2,000."
It was then too late for the governor
to take action as the troops could not
have reached the scene in time to pre
vent the lynching.
Wilmington, Del., June 23.- All is
quiet in this community today follow
ing the horrible lynching of George
White, Helen Bishop's confessed slayer
at an early hour this morning. Of a
mob of nearly five thousand that over
powered the authorities, stormed the
New Castle county work house and
dragged from a cell the trembling
wretch and burned him at the stake,
the identity of only one is publicly
known. That is little Veter
person
Smith, 12 years old, who fell when the
work house guards fired a volley into
the ranks of the attacking mob. The
lad was struck by a bullet which entered
his back and is thought to have
penetrated his kidneys. At the homeopathic
hospital, where the injured boy
was immediately taken, the physicians
stated that he is in a serious condition.
THE BRUTE'S CONFESSION.
White's confession, made just before
the torch was applied to the pile of oil
soaked bushes around him, was an ad
mission of everything and more than
had been charged against him. He is
stated to have said:
" I was sent by Mr. Woodward to the
cornfield to try some corn. I saw Mr.
Woodward's daughter and intended to
assault her, but a couple of men came
along in a wagon and I did not disturb
her Then I saw
. the Bishop
girl and I
followed her. I seized her and asked
her if she had any money she would
give me to let her go. She gave me
thirty cents. Then I again seized her
and she cried:
" Please don't hurt me.'
" I choked her and accomplished my
purpose. Then I asked her if she was
going to tell on me. She said she was.
I gave her a hack in the throat with
my knife and asked again if she was
going to inform on me. She said she
was and then I cut her throat twice
again and left her. After that I went
back to Mr. Woodward and told him
there was no good water to drink down
there and he sent me some where else.
I went back once but soon left. Then
I went back to the house and put on a
white hat instead of the cap that l
wore. You would not do this if I was
a white man did that."
The leader said his name was Baker,
and that he was from Virginia. His
face was familiar to most of the peo
ple and it is believed he is a resident
of Wilmington, although some say he
had been imported for the purpose of
leading the mob.
The lynching is believed to have been
the result of a plot which was concocted
several days ago and was to
have been put into execution Saturday
night, but on that occasion there was
misunderstanding and the attempt fail
ed
The police department was advised
during the day of the contemplated at
tack and thirty policemen in charge of
Chief Black and Captains Evans and
Kane went to the work house. There
were several thousand persons at the
prison at that time and the officers
were powerless against such large num
bers so they entered the building to assist
the guards in an effort to protect
the prisoner.
The leaders of the mob were cool and
determined, Warden Meserve told them
White was in cell 13 in the third story
in order to prevent unnecessary destruction
of property He told the
.
leaders how to disconnect the ceil
door.
NEGRO FOUGHT FOR LIFE.
White fought desperately for his life
in the little iron cage cell and knocked
down the first man who approached
him. The leaders again showed their
clear headedness and one of them, a
powerful man stepped forward before
anyone could strike the prisoner and
threw his arms around the frightened
wretch, thus protecting him from violence
. The lawn in front of the pris
on was a sea of faces when viewed
from the porch. White's custodian be
came convinced that unless strategy
was used there would be little chance
of getting their man to the spot on
Price's road, where it was planned that
the negro should be burned to death.
This danger was overcome by a quiet
order to extinguish lanterns or keep
them concealed. In the darkness there
was a confused rush and after this no
one seemed to know where the prisoner
was.
At the stake White's nerve seemed to
be good and he held his head up while
he addressed the crowd. He made an
other confession and appealed to God
for mercy. A strong rope was then
brought and the negro was wrapped
in its coils from shoulders to feet. His
mouth was working while this was go
ing on and he seemed to be trying to
finish his statement. The crowd was in
a hurry to get through with its gruesome
task and called out for the executioners
to hasten. When the rope had
been adjusted the negro was fastened
to the stake and the torch was applied
to the straw.
The flames leaped up and licked the
man's bare hands. He was held erect
by one of the lynchers until his cloth
ing was burning fairly, when he was
pushed into the middle of the fire. He
rolled about and his contortions were
terrible, but he made no sound. Suddenly
the ropes on his legs parted and
he sprang from the fire and started to
run. A man struck him in the head
with a piece of fence rail and knocked
him down. Willing hands threw him
again into the flames. He rolled out
several times, but was promptly re
turned. While this was going on shouts
from the
cheers and jibes went
crowd. up
