By Associated Press.
P. PADUCAH, Ky, Oct. 16.- The au
of thorities are prepared for further
- trouble tonight following the lynching
and burning of two negroes today.
The saloons were ordered to remain
closed and extra peace officers deputized
.
It is feared that the summary ex
- ecution of the negroes, one of whom
was charged with attacking the wife
of a railroad employe, and the other
alleged to have lauded the act, might
to for blood among
railroad employes and associates of
the woman's husband.
Followed by a crowd, estimated at
6,000 persons, a large part of them in
automobiles, the negroes were taken
of to the home of the woman, about two
miles away.
While one of them was presented
to her for identification, the other
was taken to a tree, a rope thrown
over a limb, his in a
noose and an automobile hitched to
the other end.
As soon as the other negro had been
identified as the assailant of the wom
an, he was led to the same tree and
. the process repeated.
After assuring themselves that both
negroes were dead, the members of
the mob lowered the bodies and burn
ed on a pile of brush.
The lynchings came after five hours
of labor to enter the cells in the jail
and were the outcome of an attack
made Friday upon Mrs. George Rose
at her home in the suburbs.
The mob gathered about 7 o'clock
today after hearing that the police
had arrested Brack Finley, a negro
about 35 years old, who answered to
the description of Mrs. Rose's assail
ant.
The mob demanded the prisoner
and brushed aside the police reserves
who had been sent to the scene. They
battered down the jail door but found
that the prisoners had been locked in
steel cells.
Failing to find the keys, they sent
for a foundryman to cut the bars to
Finley's cell. Shortly before noon, he
had made an opening sufficient to en
able the negro to emerge. The march
to Mrs. Rose's home was begun and,
on the way, Asa Thornhill, about 20
years old, who, it had been reported,
had lauded Finley's attack, was seized.
The cavalcade, when it reached the
Rose home had grown to several
thousand.
While Finley was being identified,
the leaders of the mob resolved to
hang Thornhill. Pleading for his life
the boy was bound and executed. In
a few minutes it was announced that
Mrs. Rose had satisfied herself of the
of He was to
the same tree and a number of shots
fired into his body.
Quietly the mob gathered a quantity
of wood, built a fire and placed
the bodies of both negroes upon it.
The mob and spectators then dispersed
.
LABOR LEADERS
MUST SERVE
SENTENCES
WASHINGTON, Oct. 16.- The Supreme
court today refused to review
the convictions of four labor leaders
in the West Virginia coal strike, who
were sentenced to six months' imprisonment
for contempt of court, in
failing to obey an injunction issued
by a Federal district judge.
The cases mentioned are another
of litigation in connection
outcrop
with Judge Dayton's decree that the
United Mine Workers was an unlawful
conspiracy in its organization and
operation.
The defendants, Fannie Sullens, F.
Ledvinka, James Oates and Hiram
Stephens, were members of the union
and were found guilty of inciting min
ers to strike or refuse employment.
Their conviction was affirmed by
the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals
on the theory that Judge Dayton's
United Mine
decree against
the
Workers was valid.
