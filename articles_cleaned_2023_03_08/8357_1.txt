Governor soon got together about ninety

them to Wetumpka on a special train.
Before they reached there, however, the
mob had secured the prisoners- five in
number and taken them to the scene of
the murder. Four of the negroes confess
ed to having participated in the crime, and
one of them told where he had hid the
money. He was compelled to find it, and
in a few minutes, near the scene of the
crime, all five were swung up and their
bodies riddled with bullets. The militia
was unable to follow the mob, as the men
were all well mounted and no means of
conveyance was at hand to take the soldiers
after them. In the morning efforts
were made to find the negroes, and about
11 o'clock news came over the telephone
from Wetumpka that they had been found
swinging from a limb. Their names
