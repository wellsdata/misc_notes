A reign of terror exists among the
negroes of Lafayette and Taylor counties
, Florida. A revival meeting was
in progress when about 20 white men
broke it up, by firing pistols. Nobody
was hurt, but the negroes fled in terror
. These are the counties in which
many negroes have been lynched
so for outraging white women.
