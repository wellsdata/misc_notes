Celebrating Humbert's Birthday.
A large Italian flag hung in front of the
residence of Baron Fava, the Italian ambassador
, for the first time today. This and
the unusual stir about the embassy led
many to believe that the killing of many
Italians in Colorado within the last two
days was to be followed by a show of
Italy's national spirit similar to that fol
lowing the New Orleans lynchings, when
Baron Fava asked for his passports; but
the activity of the embassy officials proved
to be of a peaceful character. This is the
birthday of the King of Italy, and it is be
ing fittingly celebrated by the embassy officials
and the representative Italians of
Washington. The observance of the day includes
a banquet, with toasts to King Hum
bert and patriotic peeches.
