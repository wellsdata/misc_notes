A friend of mine, who is a magistrate on
the northwest frontier of India, wishes me
to call attention to the fact that while the
lynching of negroes is a common occurrence
in Mr. Bryan's country, the lynching of natives
in India is absolutely unknown: and
that while the Chinese are excluded from
civil rights in the United States there is
nothing to prevent a Chinaman settling in
India, or even England, with all the rights
granted to the in natives of those countries.
