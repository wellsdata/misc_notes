Man Badly Beaten
After Telephone Calls
By the Associated Press
CLARKSVILLE, Va., May 20.
Commonwealth's Attorney M. C.
Dortch reported last night that
a young colored man was seriously
beaten by a group of white men
as an apparent result of a series
of anonymous phone calls made
to a white women.
The Mecklenburg County prosecutor
said the assault seemed a
clear violation of the mob violence
provisions of the Virginia anti
lynch law.
Mr. Dortch, who said his in-
formation was incomplete, gave
this account:"
Late Monday night a black car
with North Carolina license plates
drove up to a filling station here
near the North Carolina border.
At least three white men got out
and called Sam Junior Skipwith,
an odd- jobs man in his mid-
twenties, to come out.
They questioned him for a few
minutes and then proceded to
" work him oved." They flung
him against a concrete wall and
he fell unconscious. The men
got back in their car and drove
away.
Mr. Skipwith was taken by
ambulance to the South Boston
Hospital and was still unconscious
when admitted about 1 a.m. Tues
day. The hospital reported he
has been semi- conscious for the
two days and has an apparent
last skull fracture.
