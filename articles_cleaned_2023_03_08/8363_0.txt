THE bitter feeling against Ben Mor
ris, one of the negroes who murdered
John Ruckman, a prominent cattle
dealer, culminated in a lynching at
Watonga, Ok., on the 15th. The enraged
citizens stormed the jail, over-
powered the jailer, dragged the terrified
negro forth, strung him up to the
nearest tree and left his body hanging
there.
