MURDER CASE TO COME UP.
Famous A. D. Storms Matter to Be
Heard at Des Moines.
Des Moines, Jan. 16.- An interest
ing case is to come up before the lowa
for decision on appeal
supreme
next week. It is of the
case of the State
against A.
Storms, from Louisa county. D.
In January, 1898, Mrs. Rathburn and
daughter, Mary, were found murdered
in their home in Burlington, after hav
ing been there several days. Storms
was arrested and lodged in jail and
public feeling was so strong that it
was only by strategy that Sheriff
Smith kept the mob from lynching
Storms, who was spirited away in the
night from the jail in Minneapolis,
where he took the train and was plac
ed by armed guards in the Anamosa
nitentiary. When the case came
up it was taken to Wapello on a
change of venue for trial. Storms
was convicted and received a life sentence
in Ft. Madison. The main
ground urged for reversal in the supreme
court is that the lower court
erred in allowing an alleged confession
which was obtained under peculiar
, circumstances, to go to the jury.
