Another extract relates a case of Lynch law. The
victim was a pay- master who defrauded the troops
with base coin; the members of the Lynch Court
were the defrauded soldiers, who beat him to death.
His father appealed to the Board of Punishments for
vengeance on the Lynchers, but was told that whoso-
provoked the public indignation must take the
ever consequences.
