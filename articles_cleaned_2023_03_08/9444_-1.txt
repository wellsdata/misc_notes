Influenced by the incesant and emphatio
preachings of Victor Hugo and others public opin
fon was seized by a caprice and farored the re
peal of the death penalty. It was almost the
fashion. All who were liberal or nearly 30,
gald on all occasions," What right have we
to take a man's life? What right have we to pan
ish? What good does it do It makes the peo
ple crael" And so on and so on, in a dood of sentimentality
and humanitariaism, just as if the
first right of man in society was not to defend his
associates against those who attack them; as if,
the death penalty being ahenshed, every man
would not svenge himself and all the person who
killed his mother or sister, and as if the les talionis,
including lynch law was not the primordial law
on earth.,
