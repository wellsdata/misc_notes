Violence Is Anarchy.
Lynch law is anarchy pure and simple, and of the worst kind be
cause it has the semblance of restraining vice; as if crime could be
restrained by crime or expiated by committing a second. In the
inhuman tortures of the lyncher Americans have gained the
able reputation of surpassing the semi- civilized Filipinos or even unenvi the
most barbarous tribes. The lyncher, like the anarchist, ignores the
law. Corruption and fraud on the part of those set in high places to
interpret and execute law are responsible for lynching, and cultivates
and inspires the red- handed anarchy that has slain twelve per
of all our Presidents, and that, too, in less than forty years. cent
