The Wadesboro Messenger and In
telligencer says that the family of
Hough, the negro lynched in Anson,
refused to have anything to do with
the body and the negroes refused to
let him be buried in their graveyard,
hence the coroner had him buried at
the foot of the tree to which he
was hung. Not a negro could be
hired to dig the grave or in any way
assist in disposing of the body
