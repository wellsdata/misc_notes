NORTHERN MALTREATMENT OF THE
NEGRO.
It generally happens that when
a negro committs the crime of rape
on a white woman in the South,
The
Southern men lynch him.
best sentiment in the South is op
posed to lynching and many
Southern newspapers, including
The Post, advocate a special
of court to try rape cases immed term
iately upon the commission of the
erime.
Many Northern newspapers, ignoring
this attitute on the part of
and
many Southern newspapers
the best citizens of the South ignoring
the great provocation from
the crime, and saying not one
word in condemnation of the
criminal or in sympathy with the
vietim, have chosen to denounce
the South for the lynchings which
have occurred within its borders.
By many Northern journalists, the
negro who is lynched for raping a
white woman is regarded as a mar
tyr and is put upon a level with
the holy men of history, the saints
who died for the Christian faith,
the
forgetting altogether that
Christian religion forbids rape,
and that the heinous crime is rendered
a thousandfold more heinous
by the unnaturalness of miscegenation
of the races.
With the men of the North this
misdirected pro- negro zeal is not
80 genuine as the zealots believe it.
Although many of them know it
not, it is nothing more nor less
than sectionalism and predjudice
against the South. If the wife,
Sister or daughter of one of these
Northern partisans were raped by
a negro, which God forbid, it is
very likely that the husband,
victim
brother father of the
or
would find the blood boiling in his
veins not very differently from the
Southern way, and he would lynch
the black fiend quite as readily as
does his fellow countrymen at the
South.
We get the chance every now
and then, as with the Colorado and
Kansas lynchings, which happened
not a great while ago, to reply to
our Northern crities with unan-
swerable facts. recent race
The
wars in Adams county, Indiana,
and at Eldorado, Illinois, demonstrate
that not only is it true, as the
Colorado and Kansas lynchings
that is lynched at
a negro
prove
,
the North for a heinous crime, but
that he is persecuted and driven
out of the country for no crime at
/
all and that there is a predjudice
,
at the North against poor negro's
peacably earning an honest living.
As we at the South are more civ
and the law
saidized
than this give-
abiding negro a fair chance and
help him all we can we have the
,
this North-
right to protest against
ern barbarism. There is no need
to answer the Northern critics of
the South. They are answered by
the facts with an eloquence and
effectiveness which no tongue or
command. Let them busy
pen can
themselves with the beam in their
own eye and try to teach their
people not to maltreat the negro.
The South is strong enough to
stand Northern denunciation,
which is unjust and undeserved,
but the negro inhabitants of Indiana
and Illinois should be saved in
some from Northern barbarity
and violence way.- Houston Post.
