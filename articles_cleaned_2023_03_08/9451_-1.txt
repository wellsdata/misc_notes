It is not true that Sacramento is demanding
that gaming shall be licensed.
No such demand has been made by this
city or ever will be. A few years ago a
local board did attempt to license gaming,
but it was the first and last effort, and a
Sacramento Assembly man was the au
thor of and introduced the bill that be
came a law prohibiting such attempts.
and making it a crime to license gaming.
This community is as refined, its moral
sense as acute, and its tone and sentiment
as high as the standards of any sister
city. That the laws are violated here as
they are elsewhere is very true, and that
not all offenders are promptly prosecuted
and punished is as true here as it is in
San Francisco and other cities. But it is
also true that fewer great crimes disgrace
this city than smirch the reputations of a
large number of our sister cities. The
ignominy of lynch law, midnight and
mysterious hanging, and other outrages
of that character, to say nothing of financial
and business scandals, have not attached
to the Sacramento of the
thirty years. last
