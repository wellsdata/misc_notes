THE AFFAIR AT GEORGETOWN.
Delawareans adopted a novel method of repulsing a body of
justly incensed citizens bent on lynching a negro ravisher of a
young white girl.
Rather than use the guns of the militia guarding the jail, tear
bombs were supplied and these exploded in the midst of the
crowd. These were more humane and possibly as effective as bul
lets. The use of these also showed a certain sympathy with the
would- be lynchers and a to take those
meting out vengeance upon a wretch who inflicted worse than
death upon his victim.
While the authorities are to be commended for doing their
duty in upholding the law, there are many who are of the opinion
that these despoilers of female honor should be classed as venomous
reptiles or rabid dogs and shot down on sight. This may be
a savage way of looking at the matter, but no more savage than
the instincts of the brute that subverts everything to his own depraved
nature. He is, in the opinion of many, an outlaw, and
should not be considered as worthy the benefit of any participation
in the due course of legal proceedings.
For the moment, he has lost his classification as a human be
ing and reverted to the level of the lowest order of creation. Noth
ing apparently is too severe for him in the way of punishment.
The Delaware authorities have given us a fine example of
quick justice. Not many hours elapsed in the trial, and the negro
hangs on the twenty- sixth of February. This should be a warning
to evil doers, but, strange to say, such crimes will occur from time
to time, and no punishment seems to be effective in stamping
this terrible attack against the women of our land. out
