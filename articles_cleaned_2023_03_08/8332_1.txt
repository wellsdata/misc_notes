Razor, Revolver and Winchester.
Finally an advance was made, and
the posse closed in. Several men posted
themselves at the door, and as the outlaw
stepped out he was seized by the arms. As
he stood facing the crowd a shot was fired,
and Cooper dropped, with a rifle ball
through his cheeks. He was not badly
wounded, however. In his shirt a razor
was found, while beneath his trousers
band was a loaded revolver. Cooper was
drunk, and after he was shot became al
most unmanageable. A search of the cab
in revealed a winchester rifle, two revolvers
, a valise filled with cartridges and a
number of flasks; some empty and others
filled with whisky. On a page torn from
a blank book was written:" Remember
that I killed myself. There never was a
man that could take me- Simon Cooper."
Cooper was placed in a wagon with Mr.
McKagen of Sumter and Mr. Turbeville
of Florence, and the party started for
town. The crowd of nearly 100 men fol
lowed. There were mutterings of lynch
ing, but the trouble did not culminate un
til Green swamp was reached, about two
miles from Sumter. Then the mob demanded
Cooper's surrender. The officers
were overpowered and the negro lynched
as related.
The coroner's jury returned a verdict
that, Cooper" came to his death at the
hands of a mob whose members are
known to the jury." un
