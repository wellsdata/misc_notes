RIOTS, RELIGIOUS OR POLITICAL.
We thank our good brothers of the Press- the
Picayune, the Delta, the True Delta, the Bee
Orleanian: the Courier and the Bulletin
and the
are mute- for coming to our aid, in rebuking
all riot, and especially in chiding down, with
the most vehement indignation, the pestilent
attempt now on foot here to bring about, in
New Orleans, a despicable imitation of the
scenes which have of late so disgraced Cincinnati
.
But while we thus have glad occasion to con
gratulate our city that its Press, almost in a
body, has at once, in utter disregard of all demagogue
inducements, rallied to the cause of duty
and humanity, of law and toleration, we have,
on the other hand, to call the strongest public
attention to the fact that, shielded from the general
knowledge by its idiom, there exists among
us a daily German paper( the Deutsche Zei
tung) which is beastly, bloody and stupid
enough to be attempting not merely to stir up
our German brethren to a repetition of the Cincinnati
tragedy, but actually to exhort them,
when they shall go about it, to muster in regular
military bands, fully armed, equipped and uni
formed, so as to present a force and a front of
popular will which shall overcrow all opposition
and let the frightened Police understand that it
is the pleasure of their masters, the People, that
Lynch Law shall be administered to Bedini,
as soon as he appears here. The Zeitung, it
will presently be perceived, affects, to a certain
degree, to reason justly and to discourage violence
; but immediately proceeds to show why
it failed in Cincinnati and how it can be made
not to fail in New Orleans. That our readers
may see how far we are warranted in all this,
before them an exact tranlation of the
we place
