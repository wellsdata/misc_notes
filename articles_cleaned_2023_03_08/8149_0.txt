FIRST OF THE NEW YEAR.
Negro Taken From Officers in Mississippi
and Lynched.
Brook Haven, Miss., Jan. 2.- The first
lynching of 1908 occurred here today, when
a mob in broad daylight took a negro
away from police officers and shot him.
The negro, whose name was Kan, was
accused of killing a policeman at Oak
vale, Miss., on Tuesday night. The ne
gro had been arrested as a suspicious
person, but he came to Brook Haven
looking for medical treatment for a gun
shot wound in the abdomen.
The mob got him away from the po
lice by using a lasso, which was thrown
over the negro's neck as the officers hur
ried him to jail. After the lynching a
negro who saw the body said it was that
of Coot Aulman, accused of a
policeman in this vicinity. Dec. killing 10.
