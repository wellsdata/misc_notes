Intense excitement was created at Silver
ton, Col., by the actions of a Mormon named
Joseph Ainsworth, a burly Cornishman, who
made a raid upon the American flags used
in decorating. After tearing down quite a
number of them, Ainsworth was locked up.
He was sober and said the reason for his ac
tion was that the flag was opposed to his
principles. Indignation at the affair is high
and the citizens are talking of lynching
Ainsworth.
