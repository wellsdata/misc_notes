New Orleans, Jan. 20.- John Johnston,
the Cotton family murderer was burn
ed at the stake in front of the Cotton
residence near Amite City, at three
o'clock this morning. Arch Joiner was
hanged.
The same mob also lynched Gus Williams
, who was accused of murdering
his wife. All three of the men executed
by the mob were colored.
Johnson and Joiner, according to the
confession of the former, were guilty of
the murder of the five members of the
Cotton family near here some time ago.
The trio of murderers were taken from
the jail at Amite City altogether last
night by the mob. Shortly afterward a
report was received that Williams had
been hanged to a big oak tree in front
of Little Zion church, not far from
Amite City and that the mob was on its
way to Tickfaw with Johnson and Join
er, who would no doubt meet a horrible
fate.
Johnson and Joiner were brought to
Amite City from New Orleans yester
day to plead to the indictments against
them, and after hearing were remanded
without bail. During the day a party
of citizens called at the jail and John
son made his confession.
His story of the slaughter of the fam
ily was peculiarly brutal. He said that
he had always liked the Cotton family
and would not have harmed them had
it not been for the fact that he was bul
lied into what he had done. He said
that he armed himself with an axe, not
to hurt any of the people in the house,
but to prevent their escaping, as he had
been told to watch a door. The murder
Johnson said, was planned by Budd Mc
Knight, who was a suitor of the girl
Maud Miller, whose mother, Mrs. Cot
ton, whipped her for allowing Mc
Knight's attentions. This was the only
motive he knew for the crime. He said
Arch Joiner shot Cotton, the head of
the household, with a gun, then struck
Merven Stevens, the son of Mrs. Anna
Stevens, with an axe on the forehead,
knocking him back on the bed and kill
ing him. Joiner finished the men and
then went into the room which was occupied
by Mrs. Stevens, Mrs. Cotton
and Lizzie Miller, with Maud and several
children and killed the three wo
men.
A dispatch to the Times- Democrat
from Amite City this morning says:
The crowd at first decided to burn John
son at the stake, but finally concluded
to hang him. Both negroes were there
fore hanged and shots fired into
bodies. their
