Lynch Law Portage at.
We publish elsewhere an account of a
terrible affair which occurred at Portage
yesterday afternoon. It seemed that a
feud had existed since the war between a
lawyer of that city named Wm. H. Spain
and a farmer named Barney Britt, who
had served together in the 19th regiment.
Yesterday morning they met upon the
streets and some violent language passed
between them. In the afternoon they
met again, and Spain went to his residence
, procured his revolver, and shot
Britt dead. The murderer was at once
arrested. A mob soon( 3 gathered, and
threatened summary punishment. They
were baulked for a time by the officers,
who placed him in the office of the express
company; but they soon broke in,
seized the wretched man, put a rope
around his neck, dragged him a considerable
distance, and hung him to a tree.
We deeply regret that such an affair
should have occurred in this state, and are
confident that this will be the feeling of
all our people not excepting the intelli-
gent and law- abiding citizens of Portage.
It should be added to the credit of the
state that this is the first occurrence of the
kind for a long time- if we mistake not,
since the lynching of a negro in this city
about ten years since. of trod brail mitw
The murder of Britt, which was so
summarily avenged, was certainly of a.
most unprovoked and aggravated character
, and the murderer was, to our personal
knowledge, a man of infamous anteced-
ents. But these facts can not justify the
action of the mob. It is one of the most
alarming of the times that the
signs peo-
of this country so often take it upon
themselves to inflict punishment upon of
fenders. It argues a disrespect for law
and authority which is pregnant
evii consequences. Sentinel. a with
