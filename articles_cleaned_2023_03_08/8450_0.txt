The Murder
Of Dr. D. T. Courtney
By Negroes.

HE THE MURDERERS IN JAIL.
Rumors were rife all day Friday
that a lynching party was coming
to Opelousas that night to swing
the murderers, and the sheriff to
avoid trouble, sent the prisons to
the Alexandria jail on the evening
train. We are no advocate of
lynch law, but we say openly that
had these red- handed assassins
been strung up by a mob the perpetrators
would have met no condemnation
at the hands of the
Clarion. The negroes were brought
back Wednesday, and it is the sincere
hope of the community that a
speedy trial will take place, and
justice meted out to them. No
technicality can save their
legal neck.
