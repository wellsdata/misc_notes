Terror against Negro Americans
today in quanity and qual-
ity differs from that of the past
decade. The figures alone are extremely
alarming.
From a political point of view
today's lynching figures tell a
story that must cause progressive
Americans seriously to think
and also to act in self- defense.
Time favors reaction.
In less than two months, four
teen known lynchings of Negro
citizens have occurred; two mob
actions inspired by white supre-
macists are known; a host of
other sadistic acts of terror have
taken place. This terror is not
being confined to the South. New
York, Illinois, Missouri, Califor-
, Texas and in the North East
and North West are the scenes of
cannibalistic orgies against Ne
gro Americans.
THE PICTURE in a thousand
aspects resembles the rise of
Nazi terror in Hitler land in the
1930's. Therein lies the difference
with yesterday's lynchings. The
most startling feature reveals
the Ku Klux Klan developing as
the main instrument of terror.
The Klan seems now an officially
blessed terror weapon of
American Big Business and its
landlord henchmen, truly a storm
trooper organization. The Department
of Justice winks at its
murderings, the F.B.I. is not concerned
.
Here is no new crisis in race
relations. We are confronted now
wi a terror drive, an organized
campaign of terror directed
physically against Negro America
. But the ultimate political objectives
are not difficult to understand
. Monopoly is splitting
the progressive camp. One sec
tion is being split away and
beaten into submission, beaten if
possible into acceptance of a
semi- slave status. The other section
of our population shows no
grave concern.
The Negro is first selected be
cause the history of America reveals
that attacks of violence
against Negroes are least disturbing
to white America. Therein
lies the menace of this terror
campaign. White progressives
are not truly alarmed. If this
attack succeeds terror in full vol
ume will be launched next
against labor, the Jewish people,
Catholic laity and other
groupings. This is the fascis
pattern. It succeeded in Germany
. It succeeded in France.
Reaction believes it can succeed
here- it can.
SO FAR this terroristic ma
neuvre has suceeded. The trade
unions show no clear recognition
that they are the ultimate object
of this terror and therefore must
act to stop it now. They have not
yet learned to accept the Negro
as a full partner in the progressive
ranks. They do not see that
what hurts Negro America injures
them. They do not see that
the Negro- labor alliance is a nat
ural.
The situation is dangerous in
the extreme. White middle class
America will truly rally to fight
the terror against Negro America
only if it sees labor in action
against the Negro baiters and if
labor explains fully why it acts.
Of course labor's action in this
fight for Negro rights is no altruistic
purely humanitarian mat
ter. The fight has its moral side
but this is not the major characteristic
.
when it fights for Ne-
Labor rights, is fighting in self nroin
tection not out of charity. Only
those who out of blood coin gold
send men to the wars for charitable
reasons. Labor must act and
at once to clarify its own house
on this issue. Delay will be fatal.
Failure to protect the Jews of
Germany lead to World War IL
Failure to fight the terror now
directed against Negroes can
lead to World War III.
**
THE TRUTH of this lies in the
fact that the attack by American
monopoly upon the American
people is a conscious, deliberate
and calculated move, a necessary
step on its road to world con
American imperialism
quest.
must destroy the democratic institutions
of this country before
the people can be lead into an
other blood bath. It knows this.
Do we?
Already the plans for the domination
of the world by American
fascist minded National Association
of Manufacturers are more
or less clear. American troops
remain in 56 countries. Why?
American military forces direct
reaction in China. Why? American
imperialism in the United
Nations, in its press and pulpit
is frantically beating the war
dium against the Soviet Union.
American imperialism is on the
march to world domination. That
is the why.
ONE of the immediate aims of
the terror however is to prevent
the organization of Southern
labor by the A.F.L. and C.I.O.
American imperialism fears the
arousing of Southern labor. The
organization of Southern labor
will and must bring about the
destruction of Wall Street's ma
jor ally the lynch landlords from
whose ranks come the Jimmy
Byrnes, Tom Clarks, Theodore
Bilboes, Talmadges, Rankins and
Connollys.
This crew of butchers of black
flesh are also the legal hatchet
men of Wall street in Congress,
the State Department of Justice
so- called. Big money cannot lose
this cannibal crew at this momentous
hour.
It needs them desperately
to organize and lead the terror
nationally and internationally.
Let us drive this gang out of
politics.
ANOTHER aim of the terror is
to smash the militancy of the
Negro veterans. Big Busines is
seeking to prevent Negro and
white veterans from getting to
gether around the housing issue,
the G.I. Bill of Rights and the
fight against inflation. Let us
strengthen the battle around
these issues.
The picture is alarming. The
terror drive against Negro Amer.
ica is a flank attack upon American
democracy. Fascism will
seek to consolidate its forces
through this drive. It may succeed
. The Klan will be spread
across the nation and become
the storm trooper movement of
America if it succeeds. White
America must wake up. The dan
ger is terrifying like the early
days of fascist terror in Ger
many.
But we of progressive America
can win if we fully recognize
the menace. Clarity, more
clarity and still more clarity is
needed.
Struggle, desperate
struggle is needed.
The attack upon Negro Amer.
ica is the concern of every prog
thinking man and woman
ressive the country. ******
