A Springfield, Ohio, Mob id
Springfield, Ohio, the home and head
quarters of the National Anti- Mob
Lynch Law Association," as well
As and the home of Representative Stewart,
the author of the Ohio law providing a
heavy penalty for participation in mobs,
was for two or three days in possession
of a mob as wild and ungovernable as
the average southern negro burning
mob. In this as in all southern in
stances a negro was the cause. A negro
by the name of Dixon, under very provoking
circumstances, killed a popular
police officer. The mob took Dixon
from jail and hung him and then ven
its savageness in shooting into the
body ted some hundred times. Having be
come aroused, the mob spirit further
exhibited itself in burning out all that
portion of the city in which the negroes
lived. Finally the governor was appealed
to and sent five thousand troops
to preserve order. Of course after the
mob had accomplished all it had set out
to do, and driven all all the negroes out
of the city, order was restored.
It is said that the cause for the out
break is the fact that several murders,
together with other crimes, have lately
been committed in Springfield, many of
which are charged against the negro
population, and that in almost every
the perpetrators have escaped pun
case ishment.
A
It is the same old story. Where those
who are charged with executing the
law fail to do their duty the people will
rise in their might and do it for them.
And the people the north will do it
just as promptly of as those of the south.
