Shooting of Baber.
Assistant- Superintendent J. T. Vaughan,
after hearing the account of the matter,
ordered that a warrant be sworn out and
the negro arrested for being disorderly on
the car. The words were hardly out of
his mouth when Watkins, the negro,
made for the door. He was intercepted
by Mr. Vaughan and C. M. Selph, where
upon the negro pulled a thirty- two calibre
, blue- steel Iver& Johnson revolver,
and said:" Let loose of me or I will shoot
you."
Motorman Baber, who was in the room,
went to the assistance of the two officials
. He grabbed the hand in which the
negro was holding the pistol, and shoved
it toward the floor. As he did so
Watkins pulled the trigger, and the ball
entered the left thigh of the car man.
Motorman Baber had presence of mind
enough to hold the negro's hand be
tween his legs until W. J. Griggs, who
had forced his way into the room, threw
himself upon the man, and, knocking him
down, took the revolver away.
It so happened that the shooting oc
cured at what is known as the" relief"
hour, and there were about one hundred
men- employees of the company- in the
sheds. Seeing the negro shoot at close
range, one of their number, they became
infuriated, and made a rush for the man,
while cries of" lynch him!"" lynch him!"
swept along the line of men who were
crowded both inside and outside of
office. the
