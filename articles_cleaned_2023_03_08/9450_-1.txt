Ex- PRESIDENT FILLMORE.- Ex- President
Fillmore is a man whom we had supposed
commanded the esteem and confidence of
the members of all partjes; an omission,
now fully explained, to drape his house
with mourning, in conformity with with the the
course adopted during the day by his
neighbors, gave offense to his sovereign
lord, King Mob. That eminent man's
privacy, sacred, as one would suppose it
to be, in the feelings of every citizen, was
outraged, and his residence made a subject
of a mean indignity, because, forsooth, he
had not anticipated the behests of a brutal
man, who regards with
horror a universal system of lynch law,
will not draw back in apprehension from
this ugly instance of its initiaten? If the
loftiest station be not safe from such revolutionary
radicalism, what man can be
surprised to find it, by and by, applying
similar to person
or his property? -New York News own.
