Last Sunday Mr. Thos. Kennedy,
living near Salem, intending to visit
Charleston, went over to his father's
house, a short distance from his own,
to ask his mother to stay with his wife
during his absence. Kennedy's wife
was formerly Miss Ada Wright, of
on Darlington, and had only been married
of about a year. She was a young lady
of nineteen or twenty years of age,
of intelligent, refined and highly re-
" spected. When her husband left she
shut the door and sat by the window
, to write a letter to her mother. As
she sat there she saw in the yard Joe
Barnes, a colored boy, about sixteen
years old, who had been employed by

boy had been induced by two negroes
living near by, Vance Brandt, and his
sister Julia, aged respectively eighteen
and fifteen, to hang around the
premises, and when Mr. Kennedy left the
place give a signal to Vance and Julia,
who kept themselves concealed in a
thicket. This couple had heard of
Mr. Kennedy's intention to visit
- Charleston, and thinking that he would
have a good deal of money in the
house, determined to break in and get
it. When Joe gave the signal, Vance
went immediately to the window and
three times tried to get in, and each
, time he was shoved out by Mrs. Kennedy
. Finding that he was determined
to get in, she opened the front door, ran
through the yard and was just going
through the gate, when Vance snatched
up a hoe lying in the yard, overtook
her at the gate and knocked her down.
she implored mercy and told him she
would give him all the money she had
if he would only spare her life. He
cursed her and said:
" I've been
waiting to kill you a long time," and
at that struck her two more blows, in
attempting to avert which, it is
sup
posed, her hand was broken. Just
then Julia came up with another hoe
and severed her head. When Kennedy
returned about three hours after-
wards, he found his wife lying outside the
the front gate, mutilated, cold and stiff,
her head almost severed. The entire not
cranium was cut off from ear to ear,
leaving the brains scattered around he
the ground. A jury of inquest being
held, returned a verdict of murder in
the highest degree by unknown hands.
On Tuesday the colored boy, Joe was
Barues, was arrested. He showed so well
much confusion on being questioned
as to his whereabouts on Sunday, that
only a few questions served to bring
out his confession from which the was
above account is taken. On examination
Vance and Julia elicted evidence
showing that they were the murderers, of
marks of blood and brains being found
upon their clothing. The horrible
character of the murder awakened in- no
tense indignation in the neighborhood, of
and a crowd of 150 white men and 50
colored men assembled to finish the
murderers. The negroes begged the fifty
whites to permit them to take the and
prisoners and burn them alive. This
was refused, but a vote was taken
whether they should be jailed and
await the verdict or be lynched. Only der
thirty- two voted to wait for the law,
and it was determined to hang them
to trees nearest to the crime. Halters

over their faces. The cart was pushed,
and the trio were soon dangling in
the air. Their victim, at the time of
