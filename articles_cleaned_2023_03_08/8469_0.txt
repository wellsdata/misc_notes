Special Correspondence Evening Journal.
Princess Anne, Md., June 10.- Wil-
liam Andrews, the young negro accused
of felonious assault upon Mrs.
William D. Kelley, was taken from
the sheriff here yesterday and beaten
into insensibility, then hanged to a
tree by an infuriated mob, immediately
after having been arraigned in court
and sentenced to death for his crime.
Andrews, who was but 20 years old,
came here from North Carolina, and on
May 5 of this year was arrested for assault
upon Mrs. Kelley. At that time
a mob endeavored to lynch him, but
he was hurriedly taken to Baltimore
and confined in the jail in that city until
Tuesday night, when he was brought
here for trial. During the night a
number of men assembled and carefully
planned yesterday's program.
Shortly before noon Andrews was
taken from the jail to the Court House
and arraigned before Judge Page to
plead. He was thoroughly frightened,
and in a trembling voice pleaded
guilty. Judge Page then sentenced him
to be hanged, and Sheriff Nelson, together
with Deputy Sheriff Dryden,
started to remove the prisoner to the
jail. Just as they reached the outer
door some one shouted:" Come on,
boys; let's take the- nigger!" and
a rush was made for the sheriff and his
deputy. Blow after blow with clubs,
bludgeons and pistol butts were rained
upon the head of the prisoner, in spite
of the officers to shield him.
Judge Page ran out of the court
room and implored the crowd to wait
and let justice take its course, but he
might as well have talked to the wind
The sheriff and his deputy were soon
overpowered, and then the maddened
crowd pounced upon the negro, threw
him to the ground and kicked him into
complete insensibility.
Meanwhile a rope had been procured
and, picking up the inanimate figure
from the ground, the infuriated mob
placed the rope around the neck of the
dying man, and, dragging the body to
a tree within a hundred yards of the
Court House door, threw the rope over
and swung the body into the
a limb
air. Then a dozen bullets were fired
into the body, and it was left dangling
until the coroner ordered it to be cut
down. No attempt at disguise was
made by any of those who participated
in the lynching.
Andrews was brought to Wilmington
on Tuesday night by Sheriff Nelson
and lodged in the City Hall for an
hour. over
