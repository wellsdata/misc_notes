Baker, Ore., July 17.- Coroner West
arrived at Whitney about noon today
to hold an inquest over the body of
the unidentified man lynched Thursday
by two masked men following an at
tempted criminal assault on Grace
old
of Bart Hardman, a rancher of Audrey.
The district attorney and two deputy
sheriffs were at Audrey today at
tempting to find a clue to the identity
of the lynchers, but with slight chances
of success. The settlers of the dis
triet are in sympathy with them, and
will not divulge any information that
might lead to their apprehension. It
was learned today that Tom Tureman,
another rancher, was with Hardman
when the two masked men intercepted
him on the highway and took possession
of the prisoner, at the points of revolvers
.
17.- Little hope was
entertained by Sheriff Kand of apprehending
the two masked men who seized
an unidentified man, apparently a
tramp, being brought to Baker by J. B.
Hardman, after he had confessed that
he had attempted to criminally assault
Hardman's eight- year- old daughter,
Grace, and hung him to a tree in a
canyon between Whitney and Audrey,
in the Upper Burnt river country.
So silently and methodically did the
grim avengers work that not the least
clue to their identity was left behind.
Hardman and his prisoner were rid
ing on horseback toward Whitney late
yesterday to entrain for Baker, when
confronted by the masked men, similar
ly mounted. They secured possession of
the prisoner despite Hardman's plead
0ings that the law be allowed to take
its course, and galloped away.
Silent But Swift Work.
Reaching the lonely canyon, they
placed a rope about the man's neck,
threw one end over the branch of a
tall tree, tied his feet together so that
he could not struggle, strung him up
and then rode away.
It was believed the men who dispensed
summary justice did so under
the impression that the man had sue
ceeded in his purpose. A rumor to this
effect had spread through the country
side, where Hardman is a prominent
and popular rancher.
The body was found by Deputy Sher
iff Jackson and Charles Nibley of
Whitney, but was left hanging until
Coroner West arrives on the scene some
time today. It was believed an examination
of the man's pockets would re
veal his identity.
The man, a stranger in the vicinity,
was employed by Hardman Wednesday
morning. At noon he seized Hardman's
young daughter and ran into a thicket.
Her cries brought assistance before she
was harmed, but the man escaped.
was later captured and confessed. He
