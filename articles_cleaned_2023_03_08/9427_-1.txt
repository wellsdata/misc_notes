EDITOR JOURNAL: -- Your correspondent
" West Ender," in speaking
of the rope dangling over the heads of
wife beaters and of the noose forming
itself into a necktie, etc.,( I quote
from memory) seems almost to advocate
lynch law. Your present writer
is not in favor of lynch law, but ad
mits that it is better than no law at
all. The fact is, Mr. Editor, that those
are very critical cases. If the beaten
wife will not testify, who will? And
she -- the poor abused slave of a tyrant
--may have plenty of reasons to suffer
and endure silently. But the grand
jury ought to look up such cases and
find a" true bill" against this modern
class of slave drivers, or they
get leave of absence. X. Y. should Z.
