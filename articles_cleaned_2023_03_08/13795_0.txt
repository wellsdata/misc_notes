FRANKFORT, Oct. 25.- War is lowering
upon the reported organized mob of East-
ern Kentucky. Reports were received to
night that loud threats were made against
the prisoners, Neal and Craft, who, the
mob says, shall be hung whether the soldiers
become their escort or not. Simultaneously
with this report came Judge Brown's
letter requesting Gov. Blackburn to send
the State Guards. The Judge says he is
satisfied that harm will befall the prisoners
unless the Governor complies with his re-
quest. Thereupon orders were made out
for the following Companies, with instructions
to rendezvous at Lexington next
Sunday and proceed to Catlettsburg with
Neal and Craft next Monday: The McCreary
Guards, Capt. J. Lampton Price;
Nuckols Guards, Capt. Jos. Rodman, of
this city; Blackburn Guards, of Midway;
Lexington Guards, of Lexington; Emmet
Rifles, of Maysville, a section of the Light
Artillery, from Louisville, and possibly a
company of is
the intention to muster between 200 and
250 men together with the artillerists, all
of whom will be under the command of
Maj. Allen, of Lexington. Gov. Blackburn
telegraphed to Maj. Castleman, of
Louisville, taight to get his artillerists
in readiness, and that he would be down
ou the early train to- morrow morning to
hold a conference on the threatened prospect
. A telegram was also sent to Judge
Brown, of Catlettsburg, telling him of the
intention to send the prisoners up next
Monday, instead of next Friday- the day
get for the trial- the reason being that a
night attack on the train is apprehended,
to avoid which a special train will be er.-
gaged for Monday morning, and a sharp
Look- out kept all the way up. The Governor
says the prisoners must and shall
have a trial, if it requires the whole
force of fair the State Guard.
