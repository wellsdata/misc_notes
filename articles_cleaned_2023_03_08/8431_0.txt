Murder and Lynching.
Special to the Globe.
CINCINNATI, O., Aug. 17.- A sensational
tragedy was enacted this
early morn
ing at Huron Station, Ind., and the little
town is now in a whirl
of excitement
While Mr. Davis, the station agent of the
Ohio& Mississippi
railway, was dozing in
his office a tramp entered.

door. The tramp resisted stubbornly, but

they procured a rope and strung him up.
For several hours his dead body was swing

down. Much excitement exists and the
town is filling up with people from the
surrounding country. The murderer
