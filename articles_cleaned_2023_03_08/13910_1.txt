He Will Be Lynched if Caught.
LEESBURG, Fla .. Dec. 28.- There are a thou
sand and one reports concerning the capture
and lynching of Mike, the negro murderer of
Conductor Paramore, but so far nothing definite
can be learned. The entire population of
the county are aroused, and all are hunting for
the murderer. If caught he will be lynched.
Many think he is being harbored by negroes
living in the country and that several of their
secret societies will aid in his escape. The
negroes are greatly excited and will not listen
to reason. The armed posses now out mean
business, and if the armed negroes
they will pay the penalty. interfere
