THE NEGRO- JEWISH PROBLEM
A tragi- comic spectacle is unfolding itself before our eyes. While
the Jew is massacred in the Ghetto of Poland, the Negro is lynched on
the plains of Mississippi, and yet both insist on facing their doom separately
, while together they could stand up and fight. And there is even
more. While there is little difference between the hotel- desk sign" For
Gentiles Only" and the Jim Crow car, we find a substantial amount of
friction between the two brow- beaten minorities.
History has been moving in our direction. Today the Negro and
the Jewish communities, each within themselves, are more closely
united than ever before. This is no longer the time for separatism;
we must now array our forces with those of the Negro. We must make
their valid objectives our own obligation. And conversely, the Negro
should incorporate our valid objectives into his program of action. This
would not only help eliminate the conflicts between us, but our union
would also further the cause of freedom all the oppressed in the
world. for
