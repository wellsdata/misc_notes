The growing sentiment against
lynching is well illustrated by what is
going on in Missouri. Decent govern
ment is not a party question for reform
is party blind. Down in the old state
where only a few years ago one or
Negroes lynched inconse
more was
quential there is a MAN at the helm,
and he says that the law must be
maintained for black as well as white.
So the bloodhounds of the law are now
seeking the perpetrators of this latest
burning of innocent as well as guilty
men, whereas only a short time ago
every means was used to catch alleged
rapists in order that a barbarous
ple might burn them. peo
