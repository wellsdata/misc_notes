A Negro's War Experiences.
To the DAILY WORKER: Being
an ex- service man, and knowing
something of the activities of the
Negro troops at the front, as well as
behind the lines in the world war, I
have been somewhat interested in the
welfare of the race. When I think
over my war experiences and remember
how those Negro troops would go
to work early in the morning and
