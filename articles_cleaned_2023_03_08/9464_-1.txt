Social wrongs are corrected not by
exposing their results, but by search
ing for and removing their cause. We
have preached against lynch law for a
decade, but it increases, says Atlantic.
The wisest of American statesmen and
public men are to- day recognizing the
fact that this preaching law and order
will not make it, that there is no stop
ping this fever in our blood until re
spect and love for law has taken the
place of apathy. Law to be respected,
must be made respectable. To get for
it the active support of moral men and
women, to make them willing to fight
to protect its dignity from outrage, it
must have vitality- must, as the ola
marshal said, have" blood and
bones deputy."
