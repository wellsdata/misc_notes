JOHN BECKER LYNCHED.
Murderer of a Girl Meets Death at
Hands of a Mob.
At Great Bend, Kan., in the public
square a murderer was lynched the other
evening by a mob of probably 500 persons.
The victim was John Becker, a white
man, 50
killed Myrtle Huffmeister, the 16- year- old
daughter of William Huffmeister, a farm
er, living near there. Becker was taken
from the jail at Hutchinson to Great
In
Bend for preliminary examination.
the early part of the evening the mob was
swarming around the jail. Evidently believing
that he could outwit the lynchers
by flight, the sheriff rushed Becker from
the jail to his buggy, but he had no sooner
done so than he and his men and the
prisoner were surrounded. Seizing the
murderer, they bore him to the public
square. There a rope was drawn around
been
Becker's neck, and after he had
beaten almost to insensibility the rope
thrown over a limb of a big tree and
was he was drawn up.
