EYE WITNESS STORY OF MOB
VICTIM WHO ALSO WAS
GREGOR BEFORE HIS EXECUTION WITH
Here is the story of A. F. Raash,
bunk- mate of E. C. Gregor who was
hanged by a mob at Harrison, Ark.
Raash was interviewed at Springfield,
Mo., by a United Press correspondent
. Raash had fled to Springfield
after having been terribly beaten by
the mob that hanged Gregor. The
correspondent says that Raash, when
interviewed, was covered with bruises
caused by blows from gun butts and
one eye was black and blue.
" Gregor couldn't possibly have had
anything to do with the burning of
. M.& N. A. bridges because he slept
right beside me near Branson, Mo.,
almost every night since October 1,"
Raash told the correspondent.
" We had been working for
the
Ozark Power& Water Company,
building a dam down the river from
Branson and Friday morning Gregor
and I decided to pay a visit to or
families in Harrison.
" The bridges had been burned when
we arrived, so he could have had
nothing to do with it."
Raash, who is not a striker, told of
being led into the woods by a mob
of 20 men and threatened with hang-
- ing unless he confessed burning
bridges on the railroad, the corres-
pondent said. He says he was also
told that every union man around and
in Harrison Tuesday would be strung
to a trestle.
" I was sitting around the stove in
my home in Harrison, reading the
Bible to my wife and three children,"
said Raash." The first thing I knew
my front door was knocked open with
, the butt of a rifle.
" Two men came in and the rest
stood on my porch.
" We want you,' said one, and he
leaned over and smashed me in the
face.
" My wife and children rushed to
me and threw their arms around me
. and cried for mercy. One by one
they were torn away and thrown into
the corners of the room and I was
led out into the night.
" The mob took me to a spot in the
woods near Harrison. I was beaten
and kicked for 20 minutes when I
would not confess to burning bridges.
I told them I was not a striker and
had been in Harrison only on Thanksgiving
and Christmas.
" Let's hang him,' cried one of the
crowd. He moved in from the out
skirts and I judged he had a rope.
" No, let's beat him some more,"
cried another, and I was knocked
down and tramped on until I was unconscious
. When I came to, I was
dressed only in my trousers, socks
and underwear. I was kicked again
. and again, and told if I was seen in
Harrison I would be hanged to a
I home and put on
trestle. went
some clothes, kissed my wife and
goodbye and started up the
children
road south from Harrison.
" I saw other mobs along the road
I hit into the mountains and I
so have been on the road ever since."
