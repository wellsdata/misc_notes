Governor Candler's Appeal.
Atlanta, Ga., Aug. 1.- Governor
Candler has issued an appeal to the
people of Georgia to join hands and
put an end to mob violence in the
state.
The governor believes the only way
to restore a condition of peace and
tranquility and to bring an end to the
lawlessness that has been manifested
in different parts of the state is for
the people to uphold the courts, ald
them in bringing to speedy justice all
criminals, and by the strong force of
a virile public sentiment bring punish
ment to law- breakers of all kinds. The
governor says:
" The purity of the fair mothers and
daughters of Georgia must and shall
be preserved, and at the same time
the lives and liberties of all the law
abiding negroes in Georgia must and
shall be protected.
" Arson and burglary and assasin
ation and robbery and rape must stop.
and at the same time lynch law must
stop The good of both races and the
fair. name of the state denrands this."
