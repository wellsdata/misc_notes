At Crystal Springs, Miss., Disposes
of a Negro Murderer.
Taken From Jail and Hanged Befcre

The Crime for Which the Negro Was

JACKSON, Miss., June 26- The Crys
tal Springs mob which assembled to
hang William Mosley, colored, for the
murder of John H. Strong, white, got
its man at 9:45 Friday morning and
lynched him. Acting Gov. Jones was
found at 8 o'clock Friday and
wired Adj. Gen. Henry to send troops.
The Capital light guards of Jackson,
were at the depot preparing to go by
special train when, at 9:50, came a telegram
that the Negro was dead. The
troops disbanded.
The crime for which the Negro was
lynched was most cowardly. He asked
permission to ride with Mr. Strong,
who had been to Crystal Springs and
sold$ 8.55 worth of tomatoes. He crawl
ed into the wagon, brained the old man
with a stick, robbed the body, took to
the woods and let the team go home
with the corpse.
After three days' search the murder
er was captured.
The mob was small, and, had the
troops been ordered Thursday night,
it could have been thwarted easily.
But neither the governor nor lieutenant
governor could be reached
day night. Thurs
