Cortez Posse Gets Alleged Slayer.
Cortez.- Joe Spat, one of the Italians
wanted for the murder of John
Jikeno at Perrin's Peak near Durango
on the night of Aug. 14, was captured
by a posse composed of Henry Craw
ford, sheriff of Montezuma county, Al
Morrison and Marshal McConnel of
Dolores, near Bear creek, thirty- five
miles northeast of Cortez. Deputy
Sheriff Jordan of Dolores had section
men watch the railroad and they re-
ported two men near Bear creek who
answered the description of the al-
leged murderers. At Bear creek the
posse hid in brush and soon Spat

came out, hunting food. He was captured
without difficulty, protesting innocence
and blaming Philip Tavinio
for the deed.
A bloody razor was
found in his possession. Jikeno's body
was cut in a number of places.
