of Milford, Del., and vicinity, are in a state
of great excitement in consequence of the perpetration
of one of the most heinous crimes that
has ever occurred in Delaware. The Symrna
Times says:
" On Sunday afternoon last,( the
11th) about half- past five o'clock, an interesting
young girl, aged about 14 years, daughter of
Mr. Zac. Griffith, on returning from a visit to a
neighboring girl of the same age, was waylaid
in crossing a woods, her person violated, and
afterwards killed and dragged through the woods
and an adjoining corn- field, to a ditch.
A mulatto boy was arrested on suspicion, and
has since made the following shocking confession
: He stated to the jury, that he had seen
the two girls pass along, and knew Miss Griffith
would have to go back along the by- road,
so he went down among the bushes and pretended
to be blackberrying. When the girl
came along, he had provided himself with a club
about three feet long and an inch thick. As
she passed him, he struck her the blow which
made the cut the back of her head and
upon,
resulted in her death. As she did not fall, he
caught her by the arm and throat and threw her
down, and was attempting to ravish her when
he found she was dead. He then became frightened
at what he had done, and dragged her to
the ditch, tied the string round her neck threw
,
her in and made off.
After the injuest had been held the crowd
made determined effort to obtain
a possession
of the hegro for the purpose of lynching him,
but were prevented through strategem, and the
villian lodged in for safe keeping.
