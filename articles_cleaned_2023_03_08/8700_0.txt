REPUBLIC SPECIAL,
Palestine, Tex., Jan. 2.- Testimony in the
are of Retent staves sharged with be
,
phries and his two sons, closed to- day, and
the arguments of attorneys were begun.
Stevens himself was on the stand last
night. He stated that on the night of the
lynching he was at home. About supper
time Johnnie King came rushing in and
told them that John Cain's child was very
ill and the folks wanted Mrs. Stevens to
go over for the night. Defendant said
he accompanied his wife part of the way
to Cain's home, returning home to his chil
dren, as his cousin, who was demented, was
there, and he did not think it safe to leave
the children with him. Shortly after re
turning Sam Hall, Gaddis and defendant's
brother, James, came up to spend the even
ing. James came over to see his cousin
and Gaddis and Hall were there to assist
in giving Edward Blythe instructions in
lodge work. They waited some time for
Blythe, but he failed to come.
James and Sam Hall departed about 10
o'clock; Gaddis a short time after. Wit
ness retired between 11 and 12 o'clock.
On cross- examination Stevens denied try
ing to borrow a gun prior to the murder.
As to his mustache, he admitted that he
shaved on the Sunday following the mur
der, and at Athens, when in jail, he used a
pocket- knife. He was intimate with Hall
and Gaddis and friendly to Joe Wilkerson.
He knew James Humphries well. He knew
the boys only by sight. He had no ill- feel
ing toward them.
Stevens stoutly denied belonging to any
law and order ague, and said he never
went on a hunt for Patterson.
Testimony in the case closed at 10 o'clock
