PREVIOUS LYNCHINGS.
There have been two other lynchings
in Queen Anne's county in its history.
John Fields was hung by a mob near
Queenstown in the early sixties for
criminal intimacy with a white girl.
The man was simply taken by infuriated
people and hanged on a hickory tree, on
the farm of Robert J. Wilson, near
Queenstown. The second case was that
of James Pippin, a white man, who was
the leader of a gang of robbers infesting
the neighborhood of Church Hill during
and after the war. Pippin was arrested
killing Mr. Roberts, a merchant of
for Church Hill, who was foully murdered
