THE people of Fulton, Mo.,
lynched a negro rapist and murderer
one night last week, and after
wards kept the body suspended
from a telegraph pole in the centre
of the town for moral effect. The
lynching of the brute is alright; he
deserved his fate, but the moral
effect of exposing his bloated, disgusting
carcass to the view of the
populace somewhat obscured
by a suggestion is of savagery.
