" During my life in school two
things happened that had some
effect but little explanation. After
the Wold War, feeling was high
against Negroes. I remember in the
Spring of 1922. One of the best ball
players was on his way to the cam
pus on Sunday. A group of white
kids were playing ball in the street.
The pitcher happened to lose con
trol and the ball reached this walk
ing student. He in turn, hurled the
ball back to the players. In doing so,
one was struck on the leg. No excitement
was raised and the kids
took it as a part of the game. In the
night this player travelled the same
street coming from his gril friend's
house. Unexpectedly a mob closed
in on him threatening to do him
bodily harm. The voiced fury grew
to open attacks and a cry to lynch.
Leroy ran all the way and told a
few wakened students. Within 20
minutes the campus was almost
surrounded. A body of students
came down stairs and demanded to
know what the trouble was. E. W.
Murry asked for a gun and said he
would go to the mob and demand
an explanation. Finally, we to
gether advanced to the armed mob.
For about 40 minutes the discussion
centered whether or not to let him
go. The discussion, however, when
the students were aroused, grew so
that the mob retreated with a
sharp promise not to harm Leroy."
