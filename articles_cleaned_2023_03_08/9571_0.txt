Almost a Lynching in Nebraska.
WEEPING WATER, NEB., September
3.-M. Lingell, a tramp, who attempted
to assault the 4- year- old daughter of
Walter Perry, near this place, Saturday,
was strung up to a telegraph pole by
irate citizens, made to confess, and then
turned loose, and warned to leave the
country at once. Lingell was captured by
the child's father. Fifty neighbors quick
ly gathered, and strung him up on a
telegraph pole, but lowered him before he
was seriously hurt. He was allowed to
pray and send word to his mother, and
was hauled up a second time. He was
left suspended until almost unconscious,
when he was again lowered. On further
examination the crowd determined that
Lingell was not strong mentally, and after
swearing would leave the country at
once, he he was released.
