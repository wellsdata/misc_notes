NEGROES JUSTIFY THE
BURNING OF WILLIAMS
Chicago, Aug. 26- A dispatch to the
Record- Herald from Dallas, Tex., says:
The burning at the stake of Tim Williams
, a negro, for attacking a white
woman, was commended at the state
convention of negro Baptists here yesterday
. Rev. MA Jackson
of Dallas
declared that if any action were taken
by the convention in reference to the
lynching a resolution should be passed
commending the whites. Other pastors
asserted the negroes aided the whites
in the capture of Williams. Every law-
abiding negro was said to be in favor
of lynch law in cases of the kind.
The convention refused to pass
lutions denouncing the burning. reso
