Byne daw.
The so- called law designated as
Lynch, from the first execulica by
the mob, was tolerated without
apology in the early days, especially
on the frontier of advancing civilization
where the murderers and
cutthroats escaped from the States,
congregated and attempted to terrorize
their surroundings.
When Judge Lynch's decree had
been issued, there was no possibility
for an appeal on hair- splitting technicalities
, nor did sentimentai pleas
avail. The only evidence necessary
was the proof of the crime and the
criminal who had committed the
erime when the execution was as
swift as it was deliberate.
In civilized communities the re
sort to lynch law is reflective of a
ditrust of the courts and the ver
diet of jurors, who turn loose on the
the criminals who
community
should be required to pay the penalty
of their crimes.
It would seem that it is such a
condition of distrust in the fair and
fearless enforcement of the law
through the judicial authorities of
Caddo Parish which has dictated
the deeree of Judge Lynch in the
execution near Blanchard of the two
self- confessed negroes who murdered
Calvin Ballard at his store forl
robbery.
We may protest and condemn
lynch law to the crack of doom, but
such proceedings are simply reflective
of the distrust of the proceed
ings of courts.
And yet the law- abiding citizens
can not escape the responsibility for
the travesties of justice which have
been frequent in the criminal
ceedings of Caddo Parish. pro
