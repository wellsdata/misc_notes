LAST OF SAM LEWIS,
The Black Fiend Lynched and Riddled
With Bullets.
Jupiter, Fla., Aug. 18.- Sam Lewis was
taken from jail at Juno by a mob at 3
o'clock this morning, hanged to a tele
graph pole in front of the court house
and then riddled with bullets. The mob
approached the jail with sledge hammers
and began to batter the door. Seeing they
would get in anyhow, Jailer Keyser threw
the lynchers the keys. As the lynchers
entered a colored deputy sheriff, Perkins,
who was in the jail, fired at them. The
lynchers fired a volley in return, killing
Jailer Keyser. They then dragged Lewis
from his cell, clad only in an under
shirt and lynched him, as stated above.
The nude body of the victim hung until
late this morning, when it was cut down.
The lynchers came to Juno, which is on
Lake Worth, in boats from Biscayne
Bay, the scene of Lewis' crimes.
Several weeks ago Lewis, in cold blood,
shot down ex- Tax Collector John High
smith and his nephew John Davis, be
cause they refused to kneel and apologize
a fancied insult. The
fled to Nassau, N. P., but the English authorities
got after him, and ten days ago
he fled back to Florida. About a week ago
he was captured, after a fight in which
he killed Ret McGregor. One of the posse
was badly wounded. Lewis was a native
of Vermont, but came to Florida from
the west. He boasted that he had killed
two men in Montana and three in Texas.
So, including Jailer Keyser, Lewis was
responsible for the death of nine men.
It is said Lewis is, perhaps, the first
man ever lynched in Florida. The
lynching white is generally approved.
