A mob composed of colored men
took John Rowans, a negro brute,
from jail at Union Bridge, Md., and
strung him up to a tree. While
hanging, Bowans motioned that he
wanted to speak, and he was lowered
and the rope loosened. Bowans
took advantage of the opportunity,
and, slipping the rope from his neck
dashed into the woods and escaped,.
