POLICE HOLDS MOB
Governor Sends Baltimore Detec-
tives to Kent County, Md.
,
SPEEDY TRIAL FOR MURDERERS
CHESTERTOWN, Md., Dec. 29.- Gov
.
ernor Goldsborough's prompt action
yesterday in dispatching Baltimore detectives
to this town and promising to
send State troops if needed, has had a
quieting effect, and while threats of an
other attempt at lynching the colored
men charged with the murder of farmer
James Colman are heard in some quarters
it is believed the authorities have
,
the situation well in hand. In reply to
the governor's offer of State troops,
State's Attorney Vickers wired:
We can cope with present situation
. If there should be no trial
Monday or if the judgment should
not meet with the approval of the
mob we might have trouble.
A. J. Humphrey, ex- chief of the Baltimore
detective corps, yesterday succeeded
in obtaining a confession from
James Paraway, one of the colored men.
The prisoner broke down under the fear
that he would be lynched and admitted
that he struck Coleman the fatal blow.
He implicated Norman Mabel, who had
made a previous confession.
A force of Baltimore policeman,
headed by Detective Thomas Hoganom
guarded the jail last night, and were
under instruction to shoot the leaders
of any mob attempting to lynch the
prisoners.
The grand jury will sit to- day in special
session, when the accused men will go
upon the stand themselves.
The county authorities have promised
a speedy trial. Some of the leading
citizens were among the close observers
of the near- lynching party Saturday
night, and they are determined that the
prisoners shall not leave Kent county,
Since the confession of Mabel on Fri
day, Paraway has been on the verge of
making a statement. When the mob
stormed the jail he hid under his cot.
Under pressure of the detectives Para
way told him Mabel had held the horse
while he struck Coleman on the head
with an iron bar. Mabel robbed the
victim.
Jarvis Hynson, alias Tom Blake, one
of the prisoners, is not believed to have
been implic ted. He will be held, how
ever, with the two others.
The twelve detectives who were yesterday
summoned from Baltimore to
Chestertown to guard the prisoners in
the Chestertown jail from a mob that
strove to lynch them, passed through
this city enroute to Chestertown. When
the detetives arrived in Wilmington,
they found that they would have to wait
several hours for train connections, so
they made their presence known to Chief
of Police Black, who entertained them
during their wait. Chief Black took the
visitors around to view numerous places
of interest about the city and they
later left for Chestertown. The detectives
were headed by Thomas Hogan,
who is personal friend of Chief Black's.
