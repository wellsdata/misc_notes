Gov. Altgeld of Illinois, who has abused
the pardoning power to an alarming
degree having pardoned one hundred
and fifty convicted criminals, received a
pointed rebuke recently, which must
have struck home. Lynch law was re
sorted to in the case of two men accused
of a heinous crime, and the leaders
of the lynchers gave as an excuse that
if they were tried and convicted by the
court Gov. Altgeld would pardon
out. them
