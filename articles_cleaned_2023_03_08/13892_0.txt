The Reveille was criticised last
week for what the critics call a
failure to condemn the lynching of
Frank, the statement being made
that the paper condoned the act.
Any reader of the Reveille who
believes or pretends to believe
that it favors lynch law for any
crime or under any circumstances
is either woefully or wilfully obtuse
. Not only do we bitterly
condemn lynch law, but we also
condemn the sickly sentiment
which is encouraging it. Note
ality the pardoning of Birdsong.
