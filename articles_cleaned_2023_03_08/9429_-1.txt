LIVES IN WOMEN'S HANDS.

Out Strongly
Against
Lynching.
Governor Atkinson, of Georgia, in his
annual message to the state legislature
deals with the lynching problem in a man,-
ner that probably will incite the members
to adopt some radical measures before the
present session adjourns. In substance, he
says:
" To adopt lynch law is to put the life of
every man in the power of any woman
who for any reason might desire his death.
I cause feel from more the deeply best upon information this question I can be secure
I believe that during my administration
there have in this state several
men lynched who been were not guilty of the
crimes with which they were charged.
" The arresting officer is now clothed with
authority to take the life of assailants
when resisting their efforts to take a prisoner
from his custody, and it is his,
if necessary duty
if necessary, to take life to protect the
prisoner and retain him in custody. This
he should be required to do at the hazard
of his own life, or the prisoner should be
tunity to defend himself. The knowledge
on the
done would deter it from pursuing its law
less purpose and the law would be permitted
to protect the innocent and
the guilty. defend
