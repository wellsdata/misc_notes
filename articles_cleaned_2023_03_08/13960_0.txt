MOB WOUNDED IN
1 KILLED AND 50
to Get Negro
Women Join Rush in Effort
KNOXVILLE, Tenn., Aug. 20.
One was killed and more than 50
wounded when a mob stormed the
jail here last night.
The mob was bent on lynching
Frank Martin, negro, alleged assail
ant of Miss Jessie Park, a young
school teacher. The would- be lynch-
ers crossed a deadline into the fire
of authorities guarding the jail.
The crowd included many women,
some of them with babies in their
arms. Two of those shot were
women.
The attack upon the jail followed
a day of watchfulness on the part of
jail authorities, police reserves and
two machine gun companies.
Fire from shotguns, handled by
deputy sheriffs, and machine guns
from the militia swept the street.
As members of the mob fell, the
fire was returned. Excitement was
at fever heat today
