Lynching.
In connection with the delays of
the law, I call your attention and the
attention of the nation to the pre-
valence of crime among us, and above
all to the epidemic of lynching and
mob violence that springs up, now in
one part of our country, now in another
. section, North, South,
Each
East, or West, has its own faults; no
section can with wisdom spend its
time jeering at the faults of another
section; it should be busy trying to
amend its own shortcomings. To
deal with the crime of corruption it
is necessary to have an awakened
public conscience, and to suppliment
this by whatever legislation will add
speed and certainty in the execution
of the law.
When we deal with
lynching even more is necessary. A
great white men are
but the crime is pecularly frequent in
respect to black men. The greatest
existing cause of lynching is the per-
petration, especially by black men,
of the hideous crime of rape- the
most abominable in all the category
of crimes, ever worse than murder.
Mobs frequently avenge the conmis-
sion of this erime by themselves torturing
to death the man committing
it; thus avenging in bestile fashion a

to a level with the criminal.
Lawlessness grows by what it feeds
upon; and when mobs begin to lynch
for rape they speedily extend the
sphere of their operations and lynch

that two- thirds of the lynchings are
not for rape at all; while a consider-
able proportion of the individuals
lynched are innocent of all crime.
Governor Candler, of Georgia, stated
on one occasion some years ago:"
can say of a varity that I have, with-
in the last month, saved the lives of
half a dozen innocent negroes who
were pursued by the mob, and
brought them to trial in a court of a
law in which they were acquitted."
As Bishop Galloway, of Mississippi,
has finely said:" When the rule of
a mob obtains, that which distinguishes
a high civilization is rurrend-
ered. The mob which lynches a negra
charged with rape will in a little
while lynch a white man suspected of
crime. Every Christian patriot in
America needs to lift up his voice in
loud and eternal protest against the
mob spirit that is threatening the integrity
of this Republic." Governor
Jelks, of Alabama, has recently spoken
as follows:" The lynching of
