" Lyneh law is becoming almost as dis
graceful to American civilization as was
slavery and the negro stands as much in
need today of an emancipation from this
curse as he stood in the need of emancipation
in 1863. The lynching of negroes is
becoming so common in this country until
a passing notice of burning of negroes is
all that is necessary. This light indiffer
erice will continue, as long as the negroes
remain silent and indifferent to the crime
committed by the suspect and the punishment
inflicted by mobs in violation of
law. We not only see the negro denied
the rights by mob violence to a fair and
impartial trial for the crime charged but
we see, that other rights that are as
and as sacred to him as life itself dear are
gradually being eliminated throughout the
south and sanctioned by the supreme
court of the nation. The negro is being
disfranchised by force and fiction of law
and a wall of proscription stands before
him with this inscription written;' hitherto
shalt thou come and no further.'
However great the Christian character
and ability of the negro may be he finds
himself confronted by this wall of prejudice
north and south. But remember that
God is just and is not asleep and that He
will render unto nations as individuals
according to their sins, and whatsoever
a nation soweth that shall it also reap,
and ere the close of the 20th century the
wall of prejudice will crumbble and the
color of a man's skin, and the twist of
his hair will constitute no barrier against
the enjoyment of every sacred and
given right." God
