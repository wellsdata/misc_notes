Providence, Ky., June 1, 08 .-
On Decoration day while all were
busy with the celebrations, a mob
went to the jail and secured Jake
McDonald( one of the men who
saved a Negro from being lynched
that shot a policeman) and killed
him, then returned his body to the
jail. It has stired up the whole
community but as yet nothing has
been done.,
