NEW YORK, September 29.- A little
girl, perhaps twelve years old, walked
out of the basement of No. 104 Park
street yesterday afternoon about 4
o'clock.
A short, fat Chinaman stood outside
the door. He smiled at the child.
Another Chinaman who was about to
enter the place turned and looked at
the girl.
There were about one hundred Italquiet
ians standing around in the vicinity of
104. When they saw the child come
No. out every man, acting on a common
impulse, rushed angrily upon the
Chinaman, who stood like a guard at
the door. He realized his danger.
Hastily opening the door he jumped
inside and closed it again in the face
of the mob.
Detective John O'Rourke, of the
Sixth Precinct, and Detective- Sergt.
John O'Brien, of the Central Office,
were standing on the corner of Mott
street. They saw the child, too.
O'Brien walked up to her quickly and
asked her what she had been doing in
the basement store. She was frighten
ed and began to cry. O'Brien turned
her over to a policeman to take to the
station house.
The mob that had gathered in front
of the place had worked itself up to a
frenzy of excitement. Mad efforts
were made to burst open the door,
which had been barricaded within.
The glass windows were shattered.
O'Rourke entered. O'Brien turned
in the doorway and faced the yelling
men.
" I'll kill the first man who comes in
here," he shouted. The men fell back,
and Detective Joseph Schirmer, of the
Sixth precinet, pushed his way up to
O'Brien and both men followed
O'Rourke into the basement.
Standing with his back to the rear
entrance he held at bay fifteen China-
men who were battling to escape. But
they did not pass O'Rourke; not a mar
of them.
was
There a double- quick tramp
heard up the street. It was a squad
from the Elizabeth street station
house. They, too, were obliged to
fight their way through the crowd that
was again moving upon the basement
store:
They took fifteen Chinamen out of
that den. By this time the report had
spread among the crowd outside that
the child had been assaulted by one
of the Chinamen. Again the cries of
" Lynch them!" went up and one man
who carried a rope with a noose in the
end threw it like a lasso at one of the
prisoners. The rope struck O'Rourke.
The police then charged the mob,
which was becoming dangerous, and
succeeded in holding it back until the
Chinamen were safe within the station
house, Detective O'Brien and another
officer remained in charge of the base

DELAND, FLA., September 29.- Lee
Bailey, a negro, who assaulted Mrs. J.
R. Wetherell on Friday at her home,
about a mile from here, was lynched
last night.
Some time after midnight Friday
a negro entered the dwelling of one of
the prominent citizens of this town, J.
R. Wetherell, and, going to the sleep
ing- room of his wife, attacked her.
There was no one in the house except
the wife and a small child, and no
neighbors within 1,000 feet.
The negro grabbed Mrs. Wetherell's
hands and tried to force her down.
She screamed so that he had to choke
her and thrust his- pistol into her mouth
to make her quiet. He then hit hersev-
eral blows in the face and on the head
and nearly knocked her senseless.
When she came to the negro was
crawling out of the window in great
haste. About daylight she succeeded
in getting help and sent for the Sheriff.
This is the second time an assault has
been made upon women here.
The lynching is approved by the
citizens generally, both white and
black.
