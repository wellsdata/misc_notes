NO SONS- IN LAW- WANTED.
Four Sisters Elope, aud the Affair Re
suits in an Awful Tragedy.
ST. LOUIS, January 20th.- From Mercer
county comes the following story of a
deplorable tragedy: Henry Thomas, an
old farmer, has four grown daughters,
named Hettie, Margaret, Nancy and Jane,
aged 16, 18, 20 and 22 years, respectively.
Last Wednesday night Samuel and Charles
Hasburn, brothers, procured a ladder and
helped Margaret and Jane out of a second-
story window of their father's residence,
and as they were about to elope with the
girls the old man appeared on the scene,
but too late to prevent their escape. He at
once procured the best horse he had and a
shotgun and started in
, pursuit When
.
about twelve miles from home he overtook
the fleeing party. He immediately opened
fire on them, killing both the boys and
fatally wounding Margaret.
After getting nearly home with the girls,
he was told that the other two, Hattie and
Nancy, had also eloped with Ned Gleason
and Thomas Allison. He at once left the
girls he had with him in charge of some
neighbors and started after the others.
After securing the other two girls without
any serious trouble. he started back, but
when about two miles from home a mob
took possession of him and strung him up
to a tree.
The old man was terribly strict with the
girls. He would hardly let them out of
his sight, and hence the elopement. He
always bragged that he would not be both
ered with lazy sons- in- law. Public feeling
is strongly in favor of lynching.
died last night. Margaret
