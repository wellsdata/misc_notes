THE awful tragedy in Louisville where
in a miserable cut- throat killed two policemen
who tried to arrest him for beat
ing his woman, makes one almost wish
the double murderer could suffer at the
hands of an outraged people the justice
that the courts will be months in meting,
if the scoundrel does not finally escape
under some such technicality as the
omission of the word" feloniously" or
other as flimsey pretext for reversal as
are sometimes made. We have
advocated mob law, the Lebanon Standing never
ard to the contrary, but there are cases ple!
of such outrageous deeds that nothing
but the most summary methods of dealing
condign punishment seem to be applicable
. The slow process of the law
amounts almost to aggravation in such
and Judge Lynch is in a meas-
instances ure excusable for taking a hand.
