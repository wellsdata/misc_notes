Troops to Prevent Lynching.
ROANOKE, Va., Feb. 1- Mrs. George
J. Shields and her three- year- old daughter
Mildred, who were brutally assaulted
in their home by an unknown
negro and left for dead, are still alive,
but physicians say if they recover it
will be a miracle. The Roanoke light
infantry and Roanoke blues are sleep
ing on their arms and will not be dis
banded until the guilty man is caught
or all probability of an outbreak is
past. The city council offers a reward
of$ 500 for the capture of the negro,
and this amount will be duplicated
the state. by
