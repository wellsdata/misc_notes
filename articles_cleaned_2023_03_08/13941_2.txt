HE National Race Congress of
the United States, in conven
representing a
assembled,
tion constituency in every state, and
of the
municipality
almost every
Union, views with alarm the increasing
lynch- law and mob
tendency toward
country, as
violence throughout the
exhibited by the recent outbreaks in
the cities of Boston, Gary, Knoxville,
Washington; as well as in
Omaha and
South, and calls
many parts of the
upon all fairminded citizens, especially
those in high authority to put an end
at once to such lawlessness.
Of the 4,000 Negroes lynched in the
United States within the past forty
years, not more than seven per cent
were charged with the crime of rape,
and not more than seven per cent, with
criminal assault. Eighty- six
alleged
per cent have been lynched for offenses
which range from alleged mur
der to" impudence" and fifty of this
4,000 have geen women and children.
This appeal for the suppression of
lawlessness is not only for the sake of
justice, but for the added reasons that
lynching and mob violence cause the
desertion of farms and overcrowding
of cities, and augment the high cost of
living by increasing consumption and
production. Moreover, mob
decreasing
rule is an open expression of utter
disregard for law and order, which
are fundamental elements of all civilization
.
Patiently we have submitted to the
many acts of injustice heaped upon us
by an intolerant element of this coun
try and still counselling law and order
of all forms of
and the observance
government. We say now without
good
reservation and with firm convictions
in the justice of our position, that
when it comes to a matter of self- protection
, a question of life existence
the man who does not rise up in his
own defense is not worthy of citizen
ship in a Republic like these United
States.
If this nation desires to maintain its
proud position among the nations of
the world and prove that it is a democracy
in deed as well as inword, it
must carry out the letter and the spirit
of its constitution. Any government
which has the right to make its citizens
bear arms in its defense must by the
same token have the power to protect
them. A nation which proposes a
democratic program for the protection
of the weak and oppressed people of
the same
the world should inaugurate
program at home. Moreover, we be
lieve it to be in the interest of good
government and in harmony with the
spirit which gave birth to this nation
that every intelligent man and woman,
should have
the
North and South,
right of suffrage.
To the end that living conditions will
death
tend to reduce the abnormal
rate of colored residents in the cities,
we call upon the municipal authorities
to provide better sanitary conditions
surronudings for all homes and
the and establishment of parks and breath
ing spaces in the congested sections.
The right to collective bargaining
between employee and employer should
not be denied to any group of Ameri
man citizens. We deplore the unjust
colored
discrimination against the
workman, by organized labor unions
and by organized capital. We recommend
the adoption of a uniform wage
scale and identical working conditions
for all workers of the same class.
Notwithstanding the fact that no
race representative was invited to sit
in its councils, we view with gratification
the effort now being made in this
city by the conference called by the
president of the United States, to ef
adjustment of the labor
fect an
troubles existing throughout the coun
try, and respectfully recommends the
adoption of similar action on all grevi-
ous public questions.
The migration of the colored people.
now going on from the several states
is primarily due to the lack of safety
of homes and is indicative of the fact
that the Negro is sensible of the econo
mic value of his labor. This movement
clearly demonstrates to the South that
all forms of proscription, jim crow
cars, segregation and lawlessness must
cease and better housing conditions,
and better wages must be provided if
the migration is to be crecked. The
influx of a large number of new
groups to the congested cities of the
North calls for the active co- operation
of all concerned, so that as soon as
possible, the newcomers may be assimilated
to their environment.
We advocate obedience to law; strict
morality; temperate habits; the prac-
tice of thrift and economy; the ac
of education and
quisition property
and counsel our people everywhere to
take advantage of all educational opportunities
offered them. We call
upon the state authorities to make
equal and adequate appropriations for
school buildings, salaries for teachers
and provide for a minimum school
term of six months.
We call especial attention to the
National Race Congress' Memorial to
the Congress of the United States and
to the" fourteen articles, setting forth
what the American Negro expects after
helping to win the War for Democracy
."
We invite the people and our friends
everywhere to join the National Race
Congress in its campaign of service to
our country. We go forth from this
session's deliberations with a vision of
the coming of a day for better things;
the solidifying of our forces for the
promotion of righteousness and in the
end the dawn of a better day for all,
,
in a country, from whose borders the
injustice shall be forever
blight of
banished
