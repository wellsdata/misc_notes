-Many Other Important
Discussed. Subjects
The Negro Problem.
The negro problem is given considera
ble attention, after calling attention to
the fact that no section of the country
is free from faults, and that no section
has occasion to jeer at the shortcomings
of any other section; he turns to the subject
of lynchings, and especially as ap
plied to the negro of the south. He says
the greatest existing cause for mob law
is the perpetration by the blacks of the
crime of rape, a crimne which he terms
even worse than murder.
He quotes the
admonitions to the white people spoken
by Gov. Candler, of Georgia, some years
ago, and by Gov. Jelks, of Alabama, recently
, and then says:
" Every colored man should realize
that the worst enemy of his race is the
negro criminal, and above all the ne
gro criminal who commits the dread
ful crime of rape; and it should be felt
as in the highest degree an offense
against the whole country, and against
the colored race in particular, for a
colored man to fail to help the officers
of the law in hunting down with all
possible earnestness and zeal
every
such infamous offender. Moreover, in
my judgment, the crime of rape should
always be punished with death, as is
the case with murder; assault with in
tent to commit rape should be made a
capital crime, at least in the discretion
of the court; and provision should be
made by which the punishment may
follow immediately upon the heels of
the offense; while the trial should be
so conducted that the victim need not
be wantonly shamed while giving testimony
, and that the least possible
publicity shall be given to the details.
The members of the white race on
the other hand should understand that
every lynching represents by just so
much a loosening of the bands of civilization
; that the spirit of lynching
inevitably throws into prominence in
the community all the foul and evil
creatur no dwell therein. No man
can take part in the torture of a hu
man being without having his own
moral nature permanently lowered.
Every lynching means just so much
moral deterioration in all the children
who have any knowledge of it, and
therefore just SO much additional
trouble for the next generation of
Americans.
" Let justice be both sure and swift;
but let it be justice under the law,
and not the wild and crooked
of a mob. savagery
