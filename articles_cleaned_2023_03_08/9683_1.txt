They Would not Tell.
CINCINNATI, Dec. 10.- The Commercial
Gazette's, Delta Ohio, special says:
Last night a large number of masked
men appeared at the jail and got the
keys from the watchman and took
out Rast and Haffnattor, who were
arrested for burglary, and demanded
that they name their confederates in
the numerous burglaries recently or
be hanged. Both refused and were
strung up. When nearly dead they
were taken down and asked again to
give the names, they said they would
not, and were again hung up and the
mob went away. The watchman cut.
the men down. They are still in a
critical condition. All their
accomplices have left town. supposed
