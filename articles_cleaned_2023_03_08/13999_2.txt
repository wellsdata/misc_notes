TROUBLE. RACIAL OR ORIGIN
Near White Farmer Negro Abused a
Wahalak.
Wahalak, Miss., Dec. 26.- Conductor
Robert Harrison of the Mobile and
Ohio railroad, who was ambused and
seriously wounded by a negro Monday
night, is dead. The origin of the
racial troubles here was caused primarily
by the meeting in a narrow
roadway of wagons driven by a white
farmer and a negro. The negro
abused the white man, who reported
the occurrence to the white villagers
at Wahalak. Whites immediately organized
themselves and in a fight with
the, negroes of the community, a num
ber of white men were killed, including
one of the most prominent of the
vicinity. The number of negroes killed
in the rioting has never been
mated, but dead negroes have approxi been
since the trouble started.
