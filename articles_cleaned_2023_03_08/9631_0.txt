NEGRO SURVIVES LYNCHING
Man Hanged by Mob at Dothan, Als,
Cat Down by Offeers and
Locked Up.
DOTHAN, Ala., Jan. 21.- The negro.
Grover Franklin, who last night was taken
away from Sheriff Butler and his deputies
and hanged to a tree, is again in the
hands of the law and stands a chance for
recovery. The mob last night was so
closely followed by the officers and law
abiding citizens determined if possible to
avert the lynching that they did not have
time to get their victim outside the corporate
limits and hurriedly stringing him
up to the first tree and thinking they had
riddled him with bullets, fled. On the
arrival of the officers the negro was still
alive and was immediately cut down and
placed in the county jail. It is
he will recover. thought
