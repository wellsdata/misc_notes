KANSAS A LYNCHING.
A Negro Mob Lynches a Negro Murderer
The Sheriff and HS Deputies Over
powered.
HIAWATHA, Kan., Nov. 30.- Commo
dore True, the negro who stabbed W.
Waltham to death at a eolored festival
Thanksgiving night, was lynched early
this morning by colored men after the
sheriff and his deputy had fired several
ineffectual shots at them.
At 2 o'clock this morning fifteen colored
men appeared from the shadows
of the lumber piles, coal sheds and
B
freight cars where they had spent the
greater part of the night waiting until
the town slept, and held a brief consultation
on the union depot platform.
A bottle of liquor was passed around,
the last of several gallons, to nerve up
the men who were armed with guns
and revolvers. Then the weapons were
looked to and the men marched up the
deserted main street in an irregular
line to the courthouse park. Turning
the corner at the second block and
crossing the street they went a block
further south and halted before the
brick dwelling house where the sheriff
of Brown county lives with the county
jail right back of his home.
The colored avengers hesitated but a
minute, while from a livery stable near
by and from several shops in the neighborhood
a number of white men appeared
. Suddenly the silence was
broken by cries of" Break in the door!"
and amid yells the door was pounded
and kicked until it was nearly battered
into splinters.
True had heard the noise and was up
and dressed with the exception of lac-
ing his shoes. A rope was placed about
his neck and, with terrible yells from
his executioners, he was led into the
court yard. Once he slipped and fell.
Three or more negroes pounced upon
him and beat him until the leader
stood them off with his revolver.
The
yard was full of trees, but he was taken
to several before a suitable one was
found. The temporary gallows was
finally selected near the center of the
park, within a dozen steps of the court
house.
Some one pulled on the rope which
had been passed over a limb. There
was great silence and then another
gave a pull that jerked the murderer
off his feet.
" Let me pray," the doomed man cried
as he choked, but his words seemed to
enrage his lynchers, who grasped the
rope and pulled until his body dangled
in the air.
Then some one fired a bullet into the
body and all the others did the same.
Fully fifty bullets were buried in the
corpse. The fusilade of bullets was so
wild that windows in the shops
the streets were broken. across
