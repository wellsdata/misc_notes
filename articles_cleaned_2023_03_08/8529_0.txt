For the sake of the county of Fauquier, of
the whole State of Virginia, and of the men
ougaged in the lyuching of the negro st War
renton, yesterday, hope the report that the
young woman in the we case is an imbecile is cor
reat, for otherwise a criminal outrage has been
committed which demands the specdy arrest
and punishment of all the parties implicated,
and which, even then, will react injuriously
not only upon the county and State in which it
perpetrated but the whole South
was upon
,
.
If the young woman is sana the aegro did not
deserve death, and those who hanged
him tre guilty of a great wroDE, Got
only in the eyes of the law, but of all
reasonable people, and those who shield
and protect them are abettors in their crime,
and the and State in which such
ouvide
county an
rage is permitted to pass with impunity will receive
the condemnation of all law abiding meo.
The trut faloess of the report to which we al
Jude will palliate the offense in no slight degree,
but even in that case it would have been infinitely
better to have allowed the law, which had
the culprit in its bands, to have meted out to
him the prescribed punishment. Lyrch law is
never attractive, but in a civilized community
taxed to support court houses and jails it is
horribly repulsive, and assumes even a darker
hne at the home of Chief Justice Marshall,
whese portrait adorns the court house in
of which this outrage upon law took place. sight
