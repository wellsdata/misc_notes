Negro Assaulter Lynched.
Nicholasville, Ky., Feb. 6 .-- Tom
Brown the negro who assaulted Miss
Della Powell yesterday, was taken
from the officers this afternoon and
lynched. During the night the mot
made repeated attempts to get the ne
gro but was baffled. This morning
County Attorney Mitchell, Sherif
Chrisman and Deputy Scott removed
the negro from jail to take him to Miss
Powell's home for identification. About
100 men accompanied the officers and
prisoner. Noetable among them was
Wm. Powell, brother of the girl, armed
with a double barreled shotgun.
After the negro had been fully identified
and as the officers were taking
him back to jall the mob seized and
lynched him in the courthouse yard
before the officers could get into the
Jall.
Miss Powell is a student at the Jes
samine Institute in this city and lives
at her brother's home, about three
miles north. Last evening she started
home in company with the Misses
Braden, who also live out of town
and attend school here.
Leaving the Braden girls at thelt
home, Miss Powell continued on foot
her way to her brother's about half a
mile further on. After the assault
Brown, aged 19, was arrested and this
morning was taken to the home of the
victim who fully identified him. T
make the identification doubly sure, the
negro was taken to the scene of the
tragedy in charge of officers, followed
by a inob of 200 armed men determined
that the prisoner should not be transferred
to Lexington. The mob followed
closely behind the carriage and was reinforced
by as many more on the way.
When nearing the courthouse yard, the
carriage was surrounded and the mot
dragged the negro from the authorities
who were helpless, but made a strong
resistance. Brown was hurried to the
courthouse yard, two round
where a rope was quickly put
his neck and thrown over the limb of
a tree, when he was drawn up. He
strangled to death and made no confession
or statement. The whole city
out and all the ladies applauded
turned at the end.
