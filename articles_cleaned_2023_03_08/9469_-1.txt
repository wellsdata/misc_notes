years. Ninety- five per cent of them were
negroes charged with assaults on
women. The methods of execution whits com-
prised hanging, shooting. flogging, burning
at the stake and flaying. In one in

and legs were twisted from their sockets.
As a rule, the more atrocious the crime

Up to 1892 the commonest form of
lynching was by hanging. In that year
235 men were lynched- 200 in the south
and thirty- five in the north and west. Of
the 235, sixteen were whites, who were
shot to death for crimes ranging from
horse stealing to murder.
In 1894 there were 190 lynchings, sev
enty of them by fire.
The lynchings averaged about 150 a
year until 1901, when they dropped to 135.
but in 1901 more negroes were burned at
the stake for assaulting white women
than in any year since 1893.
The example set in the south extended
to the southwest. Kansas had a record
of seventeen lynchings, all by hanging.
but in January, 1901, Fred Alexander, a
young negro, was bound in chains for an
attempted assault on Miss Eva May Roth.
He was also suspected of the murder of
Miss Pearl Forbes. Alexander protested
innocence of both erimes, but he was not
