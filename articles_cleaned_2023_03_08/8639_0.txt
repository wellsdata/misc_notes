A Horrible Murder Avenged by a Col
Mob.
MEMPHIS, Oct. ored 28.- A colored man
named James Haynes and a colored
woman named Mary Jackson applied
for work as cotton pickers at a plantation
in Bolivar county, Miss., last
Wednesday. They said they came
from Coahoma station, in the same
county. They were set at work. It
seems that they kept rather to them
selves. Friday morning the body of
the woman was found. She had been
murdered and mutilated in a most
horrible manner and her clothes set on
fire.
Haynes was suspected and at once
arrested. He virtually confessed his
guilt, of which there was already
overwhelming circumstantial proof.
The officers of the law took him to
the neighboring little town of Browns
ville, intending to take him to jail as
soon as convenient.
Saturday night a mob of colored
people, in a quiet, well organized fash
ion, came to the village, captured
Haynes from the guard, and took him
and hung him in the most approved
and expeditious lynch law style. Then
the mob quietly dispersed.
seems to know or care who
they Nobody were.
