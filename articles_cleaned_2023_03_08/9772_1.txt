Elias Toscano, the Would- Be Assassin,
Was Seized by One of the
Executive's Staff.
The Man Has a Bad Criminal Record
and Was Recently Released From
Prison Where He Served a
Term For Homicide.
Guanajuato, Mex., Oct. 28.- Great excitement
was caused here Tuesday by
what looked like an attempt on the
life of President Diaz, who was a guest
of the state government during the
festivities here. The president, his
staff and guests were passing by the
Oantador garden in a street car when
a man of the lower class by the name
of Elias Toscano approached the car
shouting and fired five shots from a
revolver at the car, fortunately doing
no harm.
Paklo Escandon, of the president's
staff, rushed out of the car and caught
the man, wrenching the revolver from
his grasp. The police took Toscano to
prison. He is a man with a bad criminal
record and was but recently re
leased from prison at Granditas, where
he had served a term for homicide.
The matter will be investigated. One
theory is that Toscano was drunk and
another that he deliberately planned
to shoot the chief magistrate. The
president remained perfectly cool and
was acclaimed by the crowd of citizens
showing their joy at his escape.
Toscano's evil record makes the
theory of a deliberate attempt at assassination
appear probable.
The president has received the felicitation
of the citizens and diplomatic
corps here.
