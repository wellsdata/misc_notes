charge of Assassin.
HARTFORD, Conn., Aug. 6.- Henry
Osborne, a former police commissioner
and one of the leading business men of
this city, was murdered by his former
negro body servant, Joseph Watson,
last night. The negro was found in
hiding under a bed in the basement of
the Osborne home after a close search
for him had been made in all sections
of the city. Outside the house at the
time the murderer was found were
gathered fully a thousand persons, and
as Watson, heavily manacled, was con
ducted down the steps to the police
patrol wagon the air resounded with
cries of" Kill him!" and" Lynch him!"
from the crowd, which surged in to
ward the officers as if it desired to
take the prisoner
As the wagon started. toward the po-
lice station the crowd, which was raping
idly increasing in size, swarmed after
it, a wildly demonstrative mass of humanity
presenting a spectacle the like
of which has never been seen here be
fore and has hardly been duplicated
under like circumstances in New Eng
land. At the police station, which is
located at the junction of three streets,
the scene was even more striking, for
people almost fought among them
selves to get a glimpse of Watson, and
it was only by the greatest effort on
the part of many officers that the
crowd was kept from forcing its way
into the guardroom itself.
Watson Is only elghteen years of age
and is very unprepossessing in appear-
ance. He did not quail even when
face to face with the crowd which
seemed so anxious to avenge the mur
der. When brought into the police
station he was asked several questions
and without hesitancy answered them.
He said he killed Mr. Osborne." I had
it in for him, and I killed him," said
Watson." I am not afraid to die, and
I am satisfied now that I killed him."
He then described in detail the kill
ing, after which he was locked up
and a police officer placed as a guard
over him.
Mr. Osborne was deliberately killed
by Watson out of revenge for being
discharged as. valet. He went to the
Osborne house to commit the murder
and not to rob, as it was first supposed
. Mr. Osborne's family were at
their summer cottage at Crescent
Beach, near New London, but Mr. Os
borne slept at home each night. Watson
said that he got into the house by
a key.
As Watson went upstairs he heard
Mr. Osborne stirring about and met
him the bathroom door, firing one
shot. at Mr. Osborne, who was in his
upnight robe into his bedroom leav-
ran,
,
ing a trail of blood on the floor. The
negro followed and twice more shot
Mr. Osborne, both bullets taking effect
.
The wounded man must have under
gone terrible mental agony, as powder
marks on his face and body indicate
that the negro stood right over him as
he fired the second and third shots. It
was just at this point that the first ink
ling of the tragedy reached the neigh
bors, for with the pistol shots were
heard the words" Save me." The sound
of the shots and the dying words of
the victim were heard by several per
sons on the street, and some one ran
for an officer.
Sergeant Dietrich was on the street
with several officers and on being in
formed of the suspicious noise rushed
to the house and forced an entrance.
Mr. Osborne was found stretched full
length on the floor of the hall on the
second story, a pool of blood being at
his side. He was faint, but managed
to say to the officer that Joe, the negro,
had shot him and that there was no
for it. Dr. E. C. King, a neigh
bor cause, had arrived, and he ordered the
