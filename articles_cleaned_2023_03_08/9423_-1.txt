We have heard some complanet of parties,
not having the fear of the law, nor of God,
before their eyes, who have been interrupt
the of di
vision of the Methodist denomination in this
communities. Upon general
and adjacent
privers of mob or Lynch law, but touching
savors
the troubles above alluded to, we must con-
fess that while the Southern branch of Meth
odiam may have a clear legal right to hold
meetings in this section of the country, yet,
under many circumstances, which we forbear
to elaborate, we think they manifest as much
bad taste as Christian zeal in their persist
ency to exercise that right where it is so ob
noxious to a large majority of the Methodist
denomination. There are other and larger
fields, where they can find abundant occa
fields, where th, and where they would be far
welcome than loyal East Tennessee
more in.
