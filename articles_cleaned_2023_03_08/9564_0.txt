Mob Leaders Indicted.
Several alleged leaders of the Hunts
ville mob have been indicted in the
United States district court presided
over by Judge Thomas G. Jones, and
if a conviction should follow, no doubt
a case would be carried to the United
States supreme court, and we would
whether the thirteenth
then know
amendment covers mops, and if so, to
what extent.
The question is one that lawyers dis
agree over. At first sight it would
seem difficult to stretch the thirteenth
amendment that far, but speculation
is unnecessary if the supreme court
is to have a case involving the weighty
matter suggested by Judge Jones in
hi charge to the jury that has just
been discharged.
Newspapers far and near have dis
cussed Judge Jones' charge, and in the
south it is felt that if his views be
sustained by the court of last resort,
undue interference on the part of the
general government in local affairs
would follow. Such interference could
be headed off by stopping mobs. If
the worst come, public sentiment can
at any rate put an end to federal interference
by simply restoring the supremacy
of law, something we should
do in any event.
We can readily keep the general
government out by doing our full duty.
The Huntsville lynching bids fair to
become not only a historic case, but a
turning point. We are about to turn
away from anarchy to law and order.
When do that there will be no
room for we federal interference.
