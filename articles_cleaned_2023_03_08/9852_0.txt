PORT JERVIS, N. Y., June 3.- The incidents
of the journey of Jackson, the negro
who was lynched here last night for a
brutal assault on Miss Teena McMahon,
were of a most exciting character. At every
electric light a halt was made by the mob
and the subject of immediate lynching dis
cussed. When the procession had reached
a point on Sussex street opposite the residence
of Lawyer Carr, one excited citizen
made a violent harangue, urging hanging
without delay.
Johnson was dragged along the streets
at the end of a rope, and was kicked and
pounded by the mob without mercy,
When the place of lynching was reached
his clothing had been literally torn from
his body, and he was in a bleeding condition
.
The scene was appalling beyond description
. The yells of the doomed man could
be heard for blocks, and his distorted and
agonized features could be plainly seen
under the glare of a neighboring
electric
light.
After having hung for more than an
hour in plain view of thousands of people
the body was taken down and sent to an
undertaker's establishment. The work of
the lynchers seems to be approved by the
