THREE NEGROES LYNCHED.
A Leesburg, Ga., Mob Dispensed Justice
by Wholesale Last
Evening.
ATLANTA, GA., Feb. 11.- A telephone
message at midnight from Leesburg, in the
southern part of the state, says a mob took
Cupid Redding and two other negroes
from the jail there to- night and lynched
them. The message did not say where the
mob had come from, but was to the effect
that they were apparently well organized
, and, on reaching the jail, quick
y demanded the keys. They were deliver
ed after a short parley with the sheriff and
the mob entered the jail. The three negroes
were secured, and, according to the tele
phone advices, the mob started for the
woods with them.
Governor Candler to- night ordered a com
pany of state militia from Albany to Lees
burg, to prevent, if possible, the lynching
of a negro at the latter place. It was re
ported to the governor by the sheriff of
Lee county that a party of lynchers would
take the regular night train at Smithville
and come to Leesburg for the purpose of
lynching the negro. The governor was not
informed of the negro's name, but was
told that he had been arrested and jailed
at Leesburg during the afternoon.
The trio lynched were concerned in the
outrage of a Mrs. Maroney, which was
one of the most atrocious crimes of the
century.
In December the house of John Maroney,
a school teacher, was entered by Cupid
Redding and two companions. The leader
of the black trio ordered Mrs. Maroney to
tie her husband's hands behind his back,
after which they bound him to a bed. The
negroes then ransacked the house, and
having completed this part of their work,
Redding outraged Mrs. Maroney in sight
of her helpless and infuriated husband. The
negroes escaped and although the state has
offered heavy rewards, the negro was not
captured until this afternoon. His two accomplices
, however, whose names are un-'
known, were arrested ten days ago. Lees
burg has no night operator informa
toin by telegraph is unobtainable and.
