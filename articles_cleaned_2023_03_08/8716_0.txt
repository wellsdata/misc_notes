So far as we remember, the question has
never been tested in this State as to the civil
liability of lynchers for the death of a victim.
The suit brought in the federal court against
certain citizens of Dearborn county for the
lynching of one Watkins last summer will
raise the question. The suit is brought by
the administrator of the deceased, on behalf
of his heirs, and he lays his damages at$ 10,
000.
It would have a most healthy efect if
some of the executors of lynch law could be
criminally prosecuted and punished, but a
judgment for good, damages will be a
step in the right direction round.
