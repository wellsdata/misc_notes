LYNCH LAW NORTH AND SOUTH.
The Northern newspapers are com
ing to the conclusion that a negro
criminal is in just as much danger of
being lynched in the North as in the
South. This statement is based upon
the comments of some of the Northern
papers on the recent lynching in
Springfield, 0. In these comments it
is admitted that the lynchings are
based upon race hostility. White men
not
who commit similar crimes are
lynched.
that
And it is a safe proposition
white men in the North are just as
ready to lynch a negro as white men
in the South are. On Sunday a most
took place at
outrageous lynching
Springfield, O. And the authorities
were not nearly so active and efficient
in their efforts to prevent the
outrage as is generally the case when
lynching is threatened in a Southern
state a.
Yesterday an attempt was made to
lynch a negro at Murphysboro, Ill. It
was charged that he had attempted
to assault a woman. The officers dis
played more courage than was shown
by the officers at Springfield, and the
mob dispersed. We have said
many
times, and the foregoing cases justi
fy us in repeating it, that the race
feeling at the North is just as strong
as it is in the South, and that a negro
charged with a heinous offense is in
just as much danger of being lynched
in one section as in the other.
The
only reason more negroes are lynched
in the South than in the North is that
there are many times more negroes in
the South and they commit more offenses
of the kind that arouse the mob
spirit.
There is a steadily increasing negro
population in many parts of the North,
and it is noticeable that wherever the
negro population is increasing in that
section the number of lynchings is
increasing. Indeed, it is not too much
to say that if the percentage of the
negro population in the North were as
large as it is in the South there would
be more lynchings there than there
are here.

The Northern people have it in their
minds, however, that negroes are lynch
ed only in the South. It is about time
they admitted to themselves the truth.
The race feeling is even more strong
ly developed among them than among
the people of the South. There will
be a steady increase in the number
of negro lynchings in the North, and
the Northern people might as well
admit now as later on, that they are
not in a position to condemn the peo
ple of the South for lynching negroes.
Here in the South the press takes every
opportunity to condemn lynchings and
to urge that the law be permitted to
take its course. Almost without exception
officers of the law, from the
governors down to the sheriffs,
use
their utmost endeavors to prevent and
check lynchings. The Northern peo
ple are having frequent opportunities
to prove they can do more to put a
stop to lynchings. The South
will give negro them credit for all they do.
