Negro Lynched.
Vicksburg, Miss., Oct. 24.- Gloster
Barnes, colored, was lynched by a mob
of his own people in the northern part
of this county Monday night.
In a
drunken fury Barnes murdered his
wife and stabbed and badly wounded a
negro who interfered and engaged in
a rifle duel with a white man who at
tempted to arrest him.
He was cap-
tured desperate
by a posse after a
fight, in which he was shot through the
thigh. In charge of two colored deputies
Barnes was started for the county
jail here. On the road his escort was
put to flight by a big crowd of negroes,
who took the murderer into a
and shot him to death. thicket
