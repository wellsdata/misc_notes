Mob in Columbus, Geo .-- A tele-
from Columbus. Geo.
despatch,
graphic
( says the Goldsboro' Patriot) states
:
that a
mob occurred in that place on the 12th
instant. A negro man named Jarrett,
convicted by two successive juries of the
nefarious crime of committing a rape upon
a little girl of ten years old, had been
sentenced to be hung on Friday, when,
to the surprise of every one, he was pardoned
by Gov Towns; Great indigna-
tion was excited among the populace, and
at 5 o'clock, a mob of five hundred persons
proceeded to the jail and demanded
the keys. The Sheriff refused to give
them up when the doors were broken open
and the negro brought out and hung
to a, pine tree back of the Jail.
