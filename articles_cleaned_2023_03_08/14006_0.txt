HINTS AT LYNCH LAW.
University President Makes Sensational
Speech.
Los Angeles, Cal., Oct. 30 .-" If we
have many more bad men in San Fran
cisco we may have to get rid of some
of them by means of the scaffold," declared
President Benjamin Ide Wheeler
of the University of California in an
address before the pupils of the Los
Angeles high school.
" Perhaps outsiders do not realize
how desperate and bold the conspirators
have become. Nearly all self- respecting
men in the city are behind
Heney, yet he may be overwhelmed
Those who are opposed to him are
vindictive, desperate and no one knows
how strong.
" Public feeling is wrought to such
a pitch that should violence be done
any of the reform chiefs I do not be
lieve public indignation would stop
short of death to the perpetrators.
" Heney is a brave man. He knows
that every time he walks into the
courtroom takes his life into his
hands. We he stand by him."
