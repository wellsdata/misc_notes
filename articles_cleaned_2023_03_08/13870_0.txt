CITED FORCONTEMPT
UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT
TO PUNISH
TENNESSEANS
FOR A LYNCHING.
SHERIFF AND DEPUTY INVOLVED
Hamilton County Officials Permitted
a Negro to be Taken From the Jail
in Chattanooga and Lynched- First
Case of Kind on Record.
Washington, May 26.- For the first
time in so serious a case, the supreme
court of the United States will, on
next Tuesday undertake to mete out
punishment for the crime of contempt
of the court itself, and the importance
of the occassion will be enhanced by
the number of defendants.
The proceeding will take place in
connection with the cases of Sheriff
Shipp and Deputy Sheriff Gibson of
Hamilton county, Tennessee, and of
four other residents of that county
named respectively Williams Nolan
,
,
Padgett, and May. These men were
declared by the court to be guilty of
an act of contempt in combining in
1905 in a conspiracy to lynch a negro
named Johnson, who had been sentenced
to death by the local courts on
the charge of rape and in whose case
the supreme court had interfered to
the extent of granting an appeal which
had the effect of a supersedeas. On
the night following the announcement
of the court's action, Johnson was
taken out of the jail in Chattanooga
by a mob and lynched. There was no
resistance on the part of the jail authorities
and Shipp and a number of
his deputies as well as about 20 citizens
were proceeded against on the
charge of contempt of the federal
court
The. case has been pending
ever
since and the number of defendants
was from time to time reduced to
nine. Of these nine three were found
guiltless, while the other six were ordered
to be brought into court next
Tuesday for sentence. They will be
taken into custody immediately and
will appear in the court in charge of
Marshal Wright. The sentence may
be either fine or imprisonment, or
ooth.
The case is regarded as of exceptional
interest because it is practically the
first time that the highest court in the
United States has ever undertaken to
assert its dignity or to resent acts or
words refleeting upon it. In one previous
case some years ago, a defend-
9ant was fined for some expression of
contempt, but the case was so comparatively
insignificant as to practically
leave the ent proceeding stand
ing alone.
In the cases of Sheriff Shipp and
Deputy Gibson, the court in effect declares
that there may be contempt in
failure of officers of the law to pre
vent a crime in contempt of the court
and in taking cognizance of an offense
at so great a distance, the court for
the first time asserts by action its
right to compel the proper respect for
and treatment its verdicts in all
parts of the Union of,
