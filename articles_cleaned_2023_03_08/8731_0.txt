The Chicago Inter Ocean advocates
lynch law for those wretches who
commit outrages upon women and
children. In some of the states
such criminals are punishable with
death. We think a little of this sort
of justice could be advantageously
introduced into the statutes of Wisconsin
, and many other states; and
there would be no reason for the
public press to law- abiding
citizens by advocating shock lynch law.
