ST. LOUIS DAILY CITES FAILURE IN DIXIE
The Federal Department of Justice intervened in this case only
after decades of experience showing that State law is powerless to
punish a lynch mob. We have had proof of that ugly fact in Missouri.
Now the Federal Government itself has failed at Hattiesburg. A Fed-
eral district judge ruled that the government was within its rights in
bringing the action, but attorneys for the defense waved the bloody
shirt of Civil War memories, cried out about States' rights, and a local
jury acquitted the local defendants.
The jury acquitted one of the accused although his signed confes-
sion, admitting to the FBI that he had been a member of the mob, was
introduced in evidence, and despite his failure to take the stand, in the
presence of the jury, to repudiate the confession or submit to government
cross- examination.
Not Mississippi alone, but the whole United States, is disgraced in
the eyes of the world when a human being can be lynched and his mob
murder go unpunished. The debacle at Hattiesburg is a sign of the
enormous distance we still must travel before the theoretical values
our democracy are made a reality- St. Louis Star- Times. of
