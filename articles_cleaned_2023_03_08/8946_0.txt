The President of the United States has in a
series of able speeches considered the relations
and obligations of corporations to the public
welfare. It is a matter of regret that he has
not given attention to and made suggestions
regarding the possible regulation of the labor
unions in the same wise and generous spirit
that has characterized his remarks regarding
corporations. Especially as to the lynch law
applied to the so- called" scabs" and the tyrannical
persecution of the non- union men and their
families on the of the unionists, as illustrated
in the present part anthracite coal strike.
