HATTIESBURG, Miss .. July 23.
Casey Jones, a white man recently
convicted and sentenced to hang for
the murder of Mrs. J. S. Moseley,
was taken from the county jail here

hanged July 13, but an appeal taken
to the supreme court in his behalf
stayed his execution.
It was not known how long it
would take the Supreme Court to decide
the case, and many of the peo
ple here believed that Jones might
get a chance to live.
They battered down the door of
the jail with a huge battering ram,
and although Deputy McKenzie tried
to stop them, he was unsuccessful.
Jones begged for his life.
Crying and cringing, he was led
forth. In some way he got hold of
a razor and started slashing. He
was hit over the head with a stick
and knocked unconscious.
According to the story told by Jailer
McKenzie, the mob balted at the jail
and demanded the keys. These the
jailer refused to surrender. After
some parley the door was broken down
and five inside doors were broken
until the cell in which Jones was be
ing held was reached.
The jail was in a turmoil.
The mob quieted the prisoner with
a hard blow on the head, carrying
him down the stairs and out into the
open where he was hanged to a limb
of one of the large trees which stands
just outside the jail.
The jailor said part of the mob kept
him, Sheriff Edmondson and Deputy
Joe Ray surrounded while the remainder
did its work.
The darkness of the night and the
masks worn prevented any possible
identification.
The body was cut down early this
morning and taken to the office of
Coroner J. E. Hulett, where a jury
will investigate the lynching late
today.
Not a shot was fired, said Mr. Mc.
Kenzie, during the lynehing, which
took place in a quiet and methodical
manner with the exception of
struggle in the jail. the
