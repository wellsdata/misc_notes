LYNCHERS WORK
LIKE SHADOW MEN
Negro Is Killed In Center of
Mobile
OFFICERS KNOW NOTHING
After the Lynching the Jail Keys Were
Returned to the Jailor With
Thanks The Chief and
Sheriff Surprised.
Mobile, January 23.- The identity of the
men who composed the mob that lynched
the negro, Richard Robertson, here early
today will probably never be known, and
it is not likely the grand jury will re
turn any indictments. The lynching,
which occurred in the shadows of Christ
church, was very quiet; in fact, so quiet
that people living in front of the house
where the murderer was strung up did
not know of the affair until this morn
ing, when they awoke for breakfast.
The lynching took place within half a
block from the county jail, and about a
block and a half from the police station.
The police on duty in the station house
were not aware that the negro had been
lynched until notified by a newspaper
man. A remarkable incident was that in
less than 20 minutes after the man was
hanged his body had been cut down and
removed to the police station, the crowd
disappearing as if by magic.
Jailer Hugh Gillis, who was on duty at
the county jail, said:
" We were not aware that anything like
a lynching was going to take place, and
as I was reading in the guard room a
door leading to the basement of the jail
was opened as quick as a flash, and instantly
I was covered by two dozen revolvers
. e men had entered the base
ment and came up on me and the other
deputy by surprise. I begged them to let
the law take its course, but they were
determined and took the koys and forced
me to go upstairs and release the negro.
impossible, in the face of
It was utterly
the mob, to show fight, as I was at their
mercy. My partner was covered and the
other deputies, who were asleep in the
building, were held in their beds at e
point of revolvers until after the negro
lynched. The keys were brought

back to the jail and the men who had
them thanked the jailers."
The scheme for entering the jail, which
opening on the street,
has a basement
was so cleverly and quietly worked that
there was no time for defense of the
building.
Chief of Police Rondeau and Sheriff
interviewed today, ex
Cazalas, when
pressed themselves as being greatly sur
prised when they were informed of the
lynching. Sheriff Cazalas said that neither
nor any of his deputies were aware
that he a lynching was probable.
