NOAH ALEXANDER, who was killed at
Paris a few years since, son of the banker
there, upon the occasion of a mob in that
place that was intent on breaking into
the jail and lynching a negro, and when
all the prominent men there had exhausted
their eloquence in vainly trying
to quiet it, pushed through the crowd,
and backing against the jail door, with a
pistol in either hand, dispersed the how
ling mob by proclaiming that he would
kill the first man that set foot upon the
curbstone. All of these knowing that he
was a desperate and determined man,
his eloquence proved more persuasive
than that the others, and the mob
moved away of one by one.
