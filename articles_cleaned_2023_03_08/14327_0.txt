MONTANA. IN LYNCHING
Jailer Released Prisoner at Demand of
200 Masked Men.
Helena, Mont, Oct 2.- James Edward
Brady, who assaulted Ida Pugsley,
years old, in Helena yesterday, was
this morning, about 1:30 o'clock, taken
from the jail by a mob and hanged to
a telegraph pole in the Haymarket
square about three blocks from the
jail. The crowd was orderly and after
the man had been hanged quickly dispersed
.
There were about 200 men engaged
in the affair and they were all masked.
They attacked the jail door with a bat-
tering ram and it soon yielded. On
gaining admittance they demanded at
the point of a gun the keys of the
jailer and threatened if he did not
yield the man they would kill him.
The jailer then got the man out of
his cell and he was given to the mob.
When they first took him Brady asked:
" What is it, gentlemen?"
The march to the hanging place was
quiet. Brady was given a chance to
say a word. He declared that they
had the wrong man, although he had
been positively identified by his victim
and a score of other persons who had
seen him with the child. He also
asked that some money that was due
him from the Montana Central railroad
be sent to a niece and then he was
pulled up. The end of the rope was
tied to the pole and the crowd dispersed
. Later Sheriff McConnell cut
the body down and placed it in a coffin
There will be an investigation to- day..
