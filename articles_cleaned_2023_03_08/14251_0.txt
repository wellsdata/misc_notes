A KANSAS MAN
KENTUCKY NEGRO LYNCHED FOL.
LOWING A CIRCUS FIGHT
AT FRANKFORT.
WITHIN HEARING OF GOVERNOR
B. C. Bower of Wichita, the Negro's
Victim, is Not Dead, But the Mob
Hanged His Assailant, Nevertheless
-An Investigation.
Frankfort, Ky., June 4.- John Maxie,
the negro who shot Bert C. Bower of
Wichita, Kan., at Howe's show in this
city last night, was taken from the jail
at 2:30 o'clock this morning by a mob
of 75 masked men and hanged. His
body was then riddled with bullets.
The mob gathered from every direction
of the city within two blocks of
where Gov. Wiison slept and a block
and a half from the capitol, marched
quietly to the jall, overpowered the
jailer, J. W. Bridges, took the keys
and the negro, and marched a half
block with him to the iron bridge
spanning the Kentucky river and
hanged him.
Maxle plead for his life. But the
mob silently continued its work. The
negro clung to an iron pole, and the
mob fired 25 or so shots into the
negro's body. The lynchers then dispersed
.
Gov. Wilson, who has said there
would be no more mobs in Kentucky
in his administration, was notified at
once of the lynching and said:
" I don't thank you for telling me of
local happenings at this time of the
night."
An investigation of the lynching
will begin to- day.
Bower, the wounded man, is still in
a critical condition at the King's
Daughters' hospital.
Maxle narrowly escaped being
lynched at the time of the shooting.
and a panic in the big crowd in the
big tent was narrowly averted. The
shooting was the result of the negro's
to get into the tent under the
effort flap without a ticket.
