CLARK'S CRIME.
Ben Mason Honorably Acquitted.
Coroner R. G. Redd and Deputy
King returned at about midnight
from Powderville where they they had
been to investigate the Clark killing.
Ben Mason returned with them but
was at once released from custody by
the proper officials. The inquest was
held yesterday and the evidence of
Mr. Mason was corroborated by an
other witness of the affair- Mason's
brother- in- law. The action by Clark
of attempting the rape of the little
girl was fully proven, and before the
day of the killing a party of cow boys
were seriously contemplating a re-
course to lynch law upon Clark. The
details of the crime of Clark were revolting
. The crime bad been systematically
furthered by him for months
back, and the only wonder is that
Mason did not shoot him on sight in
stead of making the arrest. The tale
as told by Mason on the witness stand
and substantiated by his brother- in-
law bore out the account given by
him upon his first arrival in Miles
City, with the exception of some
things brought out upon close ques-
tioning. The difference was that
Mason in company with his brother-
in- law went to Clark's shack and
found Clark sleeping with a Winchester
beside him. Mason entered the
shack and covered Clark with his gun,
Clark having immediately awakened
and a tussel ensued for the possession
of the gun, resulting in Clark's defeat.
They had scarcely proceeded twenty
rods when Clark attempted flight and
Mason shot the first time without
bringing the rifle to his shoulder.
Clark did not stop and a second shot
was fired and this failing to bring him
Mason dropped on his knee, tock
good alm and fired, the ball entering
Clark's head at the left temple and
passing completely through. The
body was buried at Powderville, and
a breath of relief that the wretch had
killed off before accomplishing
been his hellish purpose is his requiem.
