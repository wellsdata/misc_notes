At Augusta the Mormons have called on
the police. One of their leaders informed
Chief Twiggs Saturday that rumors of
mobs and lynch law had been flying thick
and fast for several days. It had been
threatened, he said, that if Mrs. Rhodes
failed to institute proceedings in the courts
certain people would rise and take the lawsaw
in their own hands. Mrs. Rhodes' husband
was the man who died as a result of Mor
mon faith cure representations.-
