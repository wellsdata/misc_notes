THE NICK OF TIME.
Officials' Prompt Work Prevented
a Lynching at Oxford, O.
The Rope Was Cut and the Victim
Rescued From the Mob- Previous
ly Five Men Were Shot and
Dangerously Wounded.
Oxford, O., Oct. 2.- Five person's
were shot and dangerously wounded
Thursday night in a fight between officers
and several strangers from Kentucky
who were shooting their revolvers
on the streets during the fair.
Two of the Kentuckians were named
Joseph and John Spivey. Marshal
John Woodruff and his deputy, Jacob
Manrod, endeavored to arrest them
and were shot, Marshal Woodruff in
the right breast and Deputy Manrod
in the left wrist. A crowd started in
pursuit of the Spivey brothers and
overtook them. Joseph Spivey was
shot in the right side with a load of
buckshot and his brother was knocked
unconscious with a stone thrown by
some one in the crowd of pursuers.
During the fight a stranger who re
fuses to give his name was shot in the
abdomen and is in a dangerous condition
. The Spiveys were arrested.
A large crowd followed and soon
surrounded the jail. They had secured
a rope and endeavored to take both
Louis Spivey and Joseph Spivey out
of the officers' hands, but they were
frustrated by the officers. The mob
also had no recognized leader,
were ineffectual in their desires. and
Fi
nally Everett Woodruff, the father of
the wounded marshal. appeared on the
scene and expected the mob to avenge
the murder of his son, himself directing
the mob, the door of the jail was
battered down and a long rope was
fastened around the neck of Joseph
Spivey and he was led forth. Fully
one hundred men had hold of the rope
and they dragged him through the
street in the direction of the public
park. Spivey begged and cried for
mercy and implored the mob to allow
him to see his wife and children be-
fore they hung him. Epithets and
curses were heaped upon him, and he
was dragged by the infuriated mob to
the public park. When they came to
the tree where 11 years ago a mob
had lynched Henry Corbin, the Negro
who killed Mrs. Horner, and murder-
ously assaulted her daughter, a voice
cried out to halt and to hang him.
This tree was also the scene 25 years
ago of a lynching of a Negro who had
also assaulted a lady. The rope was
swung around a limb and Spivey was
jerked into midair. In their hurry the
mob neglected to tie Spivey's hands
and he grabbed the rope above his
head and saved himself.
He cried piteously
and begged to be allowed to
write a letter to his wife and children.
A voice in the mob cried out to leave
him down and the mob released the
rope, and Spivey was given a pencil
and paper. He vainly endeavored to
write, but it was utterly unintelligible.
A voice cried out, hang him, and the
rope tightened and Spivey was again
suspended in midair. He again grab
bed the rope above his head and be
tween strangulations begged and plead
ed for an opportunity to write a lette
to his wife and children. He was
again let down but only repeated his
former miserable efforts. There were
in the mob a number of Negroes and
they were greatly excited. A colored
man raised his voice and said that if
Spivey were a colored man, he would
have been swung into eternity long
ago. The rope again tightened and
Spivey was suspended for a third time
in midair. There was a sudden jost
ling, and Deputy Sheriff Brannan and
a few assistants rushed forward, cut
the rope and dashed down the street
with the prisoner.
He was rushed to the jail and has
been spirited out of town.
John Spivey is dying with a bullet
through his head. The stranger
lives
at Monroe, O., and will die. The
shal and deputy will recover. mar
