unhampered. It goes without saying that if these
outrages are allowed to continue at the disgraceful
pace that they are happening, the situation is sure
to prove more serious than the Senate is blind to
see at this time. The very thought that the Dyer
Bill has laid in Congress so long and is not a law
yet and that the lynching evil is as popular as
ever today, fills us with rage. Ofttimes we wonder
if patience will bless our people until something
is done by the Federal government to halt these
outrages. But the question lingers:" Can the Fed
government lawfully curb these local mat
ters eral?"
To put it mildly, we would be pleased to hear
from the sub- committee investigating the constitutionality
of the Dyer Anti- Lynching Bill H. R.
13. We are tired of hearing of the mob taking the
law into their own hands so long as courts of justice
are provided to try those who violate the law.
Hear Ye, Colored people are cry
ing," Lynch Law 10,000,000 Must Go." And it must.
