TESTIMONY BY DEPOSITION.
Governor Heyward, after studying
carefully the conditions in
South Carolina and elsewhere, with
special reference to lynchings
caused by the crime of rape, advances
the idea that" testimony by
deposition" will do much to lessen
the number of lynchings. This is
in accord with one of the ideas expressed
by us in a recent editorial
on lynch law. Southern white men
cannot bear the thought of having
their women testify before a vulgar
crowd of witnesses; and to
this they lynch the rapist. forestall Testi-
mony by deposition should fulfil
the law's demands; and, without
doubt, under these conditions men
be more inclined to let the law
take will its course.
