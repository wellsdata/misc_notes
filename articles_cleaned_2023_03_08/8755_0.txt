DRIVE PORTER INTO THE LAKE
Mob Becomes Infuriated and Police
Come Just in Time to
Save Life.
CHICAGO, April 28.- A crowd of nearly
100 infuriated men and boys chased" Dock"
Thomas, a colored Pullman car porter, off
the dock into the lake at the foot of Thirty
seventh street today, and but for the timely
arrival of the police would probably have
stoned him to death in the water. Thomas
and another colored man, named Taylor,
quarreled while fishing, and Taylor was cut
in the hand with a knife by Thomas. Both
then began to hurl stones, and during the
fusillade a woman was struck in the head
and knocked senseless. The crowd at once
went after Thomas, yelling" Lynch him!"
finally forcing him off the pler into the
lake, where in water up to his neck Thomas
brandished his knife and dared them to
on perfect hail of stones then
" come." A
fell around Thomas, but before he was
seriously injured the police arrived and after
severely clubbing several in the crowd
Thomas. The woman's injuries were
rescued not serious.
