Three Swung Up.
A mob of over 200 masked men
went to the jail at Tuscumbia, Ala.
a little after midnight Sunday morn
ing, and obtaining the key's from the
jailer's wife during the temporary
absence of her husband, took three
prisoners out and lynched them.
men were Tom Black, John Williams The
and Tony Johnston, who had confess
ed to the burning of the barn of Mr.
Claude King, a farmer of that vicinity
.
They belonged to a regular gang of
incendiaries. They were taken to the
bridge, ropes put around their necks
and they were swung off. The
was conducted very quietly. affair
