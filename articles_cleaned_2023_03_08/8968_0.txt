Never in a California court has there
been heard a more remarkable recital.
The witness told how a few men had got
together, decided upon the lynching and
proceeded to lay their plans as coolly and
with as little feeling as the hunter about
to bring down a deer. Aged Judge Myers,
almost blind and on the verge of the
grave, selected the ropes to be used, tied
the knots and gave counsel to the ring
leaders as to their method of procedure.
No humane instinet manifested itself, ac
cording to the witness, while the mob was
hurrying its captives off to their doom.
One victim was beaten with a wagon
spoke and the others shared in a measure
this brutailty while being dragged to the
execution ground. Even old Calvin Hall's
gray hairs and tottering galt did not win
for him respite from these outrages
ing his last few minutes on earth. dur
Hutton withheld no facts. He described
the events prior to and during the lynch
ing with faithful attention to details and
did not attempt to hide the part he took
in plotting the death of the five Lookout
prisoners and carrying out the
imposed by the mob. sentence
