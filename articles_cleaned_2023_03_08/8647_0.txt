In a reply to a telegram from
the New York World, asking his
opinion about the coming of a
committee of Englishmen to investigate
lynchings in the south,
Governor Northern wired as fol
lows:" The people of this state
are quite able to administer their
own affairs, and they are doing
it in full justice to the negro, as
our laws and our conduct attest.
We have already endured more
outside interference in our local
matters than we will submissively
tolerate in the future.
" Let these kindly disposed
Englishmen return to their own
country and prevent, by law the
inhuman sale of virtuous girls to
lustful men in high places; hang
all such demons as Jack the Rip
per; punish, as it deserves, the
barbarous wholesale slaughter of
negroes in Africa by Englishmen
who go there to steal their gold;
supply necessities to prevent
bread and labor riots and strikes,
which are wholly unknown to
the south; feed and give employ
ment to the do the people
poor as
/
of my section; give to the oppressed
Irishmen the rights humanity
- demands- and when they shall
have pulled the beam out of their
own eyes they may with better
grace appoint themselves a committee
to hunt for a mote that
a
may be in our eyes.
" While we have irregularities
at the south and negroes are
sometimes lynched, they are
wholesale
never slaughtered by
as Englishmen sometimes des
troy them.
" Why come as a committee of
investigation to denounce the
south just prior to the congressional
elections, when we have
just had a negro lynched in Kan
sas, April 2nd, and another in
Ohio on the Sabbath, April 15th,
and when white Poles and Hun
have recently been
garians
of butchered in Pennsylvania and
run out of Franklin Park,
negroes N. J., in hordes!
