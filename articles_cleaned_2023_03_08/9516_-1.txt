to the" Post- Dispatch" says that one of the
negro county officials of Crittenden County,
Ark., was hanged by a mob at Marion last
night, that the race war has broken out
afresh and that a terrible state of affairs
prevails.
MEMPHIS, July 24.- The report of the
lynching at Marion, Ark., last night and of
further race troubles in Crittenden County
is unfounded.
ST. LOUIS, July 24.- A special from
Springfield, Mo., says that Traveling
Auditor Townsend of the Gulf road ar-
rived in that city at noon from the south
time
and verifies the report of one of the negro
county officials having been lynched by a Dr.
mob of white men. Townsend says it is a
difficult matter to get any details of the time
proceedings at Marion, which is under a
guard of armed men. A general state of
excitement prevails. Neither couriers or
messengers are allowed to go in or out, and the
the telegraph operator is confined to the by
sending of train orders.
Townsend states that the victim was a
county official and one of the b nished
eignteen. The mob seized dim while he was
to effect entrance to the
endeavoring an
court house, dragged him to the woods at
the edge of town, and after a desperate four
struggle strung him up.
