" We admit that we cannot under-
stand it. This is the most prosper
ous year the people of Mississippi
have had for many years and yet
there is a greater delinquency in
both the real estate and poll tax.
The complaint comes from every
section that the delinquency far ex-
ceeds any ever known before, and
today the poll tax is scarcely paid
by half. The delinquency on realty
and personal property in this county
will far exceed that of last year, and
yet people seem to have lots of
money, or at least the money market
is much eisier than it has been
for years. Especially is this delin-
Hquency noticeable in the payment
of poll tax, which seems to grow
from worse to worse. It is remark
ably strange how indifferent the
white people of the State seem to
consider the importance of providing
means for the education of their
children.
