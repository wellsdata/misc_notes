KILLER AVERS
SHREVEPORT, La .. April 20.-
( P) -Fred Lockhart, saved three
days ago from death at the hands
of an infuriated mob, identified
himself Friday as a participant in
the sensational Leo Frank lynch-
ing in Georgia in 1915.
Lockhart, held for attacking and
killing 16- year- old Mae Giffin,
turned from reading the Bible to
tell that he drove the automobile
which carried Frank from the
Gecrgia prison at Milledgeville 110
miles to be hanged at Marietta,
Ga
Know How He Felt
felt
" I know now how Frank
when he was taken from the
Georgia prison and hanged," said
Lockhart.
Leo Frank, a young man and a
college graduate, whose home was
at Brooklyn, N. Y., was lynched
August 17, 1915, after his death
sentence for the slaying of Mary
Phagan had been commuted to life
imprisonment.
Lockhart said he was a member
of the mob which battered its way
into the Milledgeville prison to get
Frank. The mob took Frank to
Marietta in order to hang him near
Mary Phagan's grave.
As Lockhart told his story, four
companies of national guardsmen
patrolled the parish courthouse
grounds. The troops were called out
Tuesday night while an angry
crowd was storming the courthouse,
unsuccessfully to reach
battling
Lockhart in the rooftop jail.
Escaped From Prison
Lockhart, who said his real name
is D. B.( Bunce) Napier, admitted
having escaped from a Georgia
prison camp in 1931 while serving
life imprisonment for criminal assault

returned a verdict that the mob
men were unknown. A grand jury
also investigated the case without
result.
Many claims of Frank's innocence
were made. Twice Frank carried
his legal fight for life to the Unit
ed States supreme court.
The murder of 14- year- old Mary
Phagan, a factory employe of Atlanta
, appeared at first to be a
crime of only local importance.
But the fight of Frank and his
friends to clear his name developed
nation- wide interest in the case.
Body in Basement
The Phagan girl was slain Apri
26. 1913, on a southern holiday in
observance of Confederate Memoria:
day. Shortly after noon that day
she was seen to enter the pencil
factory, where, she had gone to
collect wages due her. Her body
was found next morning in the
basement of the factory, a cord
tied about her neck.
Frank was superintendent of the
factory He was arrested three
days later..
