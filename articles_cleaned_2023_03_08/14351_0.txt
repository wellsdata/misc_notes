MOMENT LAST RESCUED AT
Mrs. Ferd Hess of Belmont, Mo., Re
lates Story of Her Captivity, for
Which Black Lynched
Recently Was
BELMONT, Mo., May 20.- Mrs. Fred
Hess has just told for the first time
the story of her harrowing experience
while held a prisoner for ransom in
a negro cabin in this town for two
hours Friday by Bob Witherspoon, the
who was afterward lynched for
the negro crime.
Mrs. Hess is 27 years old, about half
the age of her husband. She is small
with clear blue eyes, a bright smile and
a voice that trembled somewhat as she
told the story, though it was firm
enough while her black captor paced
the floor with his shotgun ever point
ed at her, and now and then telling
her that" unless the judge comes with
money he'll find a dead white wo
Iman that on the floor of this house."
" I was preparing breakfast when the
negro first appeared on the place,"
sald Mrs. Hess." I saw he was armed
and that my husband was under some
of restint at his hands, but I
sort never guessed the full meaning of it.
" I thought perhaps Bob had got into
some trouble and Mr. Hess was trying
to straighten it out. When I saw him
hitching the buggy I supposed he was
going to drive to the scene of the trou
ble. I took his rubber boots to him, and
whispered the question should I bring
him his revolver. He replied for me to
make no sign and not to suggest a re
volver. Bob then ordered us to cease
and I went back into the
house whispering.
