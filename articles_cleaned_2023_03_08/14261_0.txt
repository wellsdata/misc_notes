Brighton, ten miles south of Birmingham
, near the Woodward mines, deputies

charged with connection in the dyna-

Dogs placed on the trail a short time
after the dynamiting led to the home
of Miller. He claimed he was nowhere
near the dynamiting. The mass
meeting was composed of prominent
citizens and strong resolutions were
adopted that no lawlessness would be
allowed in the community. When a
deputy sheriff was sent to Brighton
to get Miller and bring him to the
county pail at Birmingham it was discovered
the
calaboose had been
broken into and the body of Miller
found in the woods hanging to a tree

around Brighton and further trouble
is imminent.

tern part of this county but no one

was hurt. Two arrests have been
made.
