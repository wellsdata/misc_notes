GOVERNOR AFTER LYNCHERS.
Wants to Indict Parties Who Swung
Up Negroes In Monroe, La.
Baton Rouge, March 16.- The lynch
ing of two negroes early Friday morn
ing at Monroe, caused Gov. Blanchard
to call upon District Judge Madison of
Monroe today to make a special investigation
, and if possible indict the leaders
of the party which did the hanging
. In a letter to the sheriff of Mon
roe the governor said:
" Lynchings do not prevent crime.
/
law is more
One wholesome hanging by
effective than several lynchings. We
can not hope to have capital and im-
to our
migration continue to come
state such acts of lawlessness
every now with and then."
