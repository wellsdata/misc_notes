NOT POETICAL, BUT TRUE.- The Dis
patch pleads guilty to our charge that
Stont harangned an excited crowd of
people, to instigate them to lynch a man,
and attempts, through a column and a
half of palaver, to justify the act.-
Lynch law, in some cases, is justifiable;
but the case in question was not one of
that nature, by a long ways. The Dispatch
calls old Wood an assassin, because
he defended himself, and attempted
to give those their just deserts who were
bent upon committing violence upon him
The principal reason for wanting to
lynch Wood, was because his political
sentiments differed from those of the bell-
wethers around Iowa Point. That has
been their principle from the first settlement
of the Territory, and many of them
have committed ten- fold worse crimes
then did Wood. Wood may have deserved
hanging; but some of those who
were foremost in clamoring for the deed
,
richly deserved to hang with him. Now
howl!,
