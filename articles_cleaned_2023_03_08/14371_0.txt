Tennessee Mob Awed by Winchesters.
NASHVILLE, Sept. 18.- A mob visited the
Obion county jail, at Union city, yester
day and demanded a negro prisoner named
Bill Jones, whom it was the purpose of
the mob to lynch. There was a force of
ten deputy sheriffs on guard in the jail
who had been placed there in anticipation
of the attack. This show of force was too
(
much for the mob's courage, and when
the deputies presented their Winchesters
the attacking party quietly withdrew.
Jones, the prisoner, with his two brothers,
stabbed to death City Marshal Jesse Wal
ter, of Fulton, Tenn., some time ago, and
was captured brought back from Missouri
, where he and had taken refuge.
