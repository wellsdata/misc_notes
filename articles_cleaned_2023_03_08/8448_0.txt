HAMILTON, Mo., Feb. 18.- About
o'clock yesterday morning a mob of
forty or fifty men raided the jail
Kingston, seized and bound the jailer,
Sheriff Goldsworthy, and upon his refusal
to open the cell door where the
prisoners were confined, they fired several
shots through openings in the grat
ing, killing the legless colored man,
George Tracy, confined on a charge of
wife murder. Six other prisoners were
in the same cell, but they were not molested
. All the circumstances go to
show that colored men, the most of
them living in this place, did the work.gree
While the citizens in this county are
law- abiding and are opposed to mob
law, yet the sentiment is that a good
job was done and the community well
wathrial of a brutal murderer and desperate
Tracy was on
charge of shooting his wife while in
bed in this city about a month ago, and
the evidence taken before the coroner
made a strong case of deliberate mur
that
shot herself. he
