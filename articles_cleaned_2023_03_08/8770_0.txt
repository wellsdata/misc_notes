An Ohio jury has decided that
a militia officer who in support of
a sheriff, orders his men to fire on
a mob of would- be lynchers is not
a murderer. That does away with
a theory sometimes advanced to
justify lynching, that it is usually
the action of the community reassuming
the power it has entrusted
to its agents. It also disposes of
the unwritten law and properly
rates lynchers as desperate criminals
may be executed summarily
who.
