de extracts from it:
Following
" I stan D gress to do as my illustrious
predece C rover Cleveland, did, and
assert
ower of this nation against
all local nullifiers. Last summer I felt
impelled to write a letter calling upon
my countrymen to put down lynching.
But labor union terrorism and crime are
as great a national menace, as lynch law.
" Let me tell you that the first duty
of the officers of the law, whether they
be sheriffs, constables, municipal officers,
mayors, governors or the President him
self, is to maintain public order and put
down the mob with an iron hand."
After advising Donnelly to put a stop
to the strike the President is represent
ed as saying:
" In any case be assured I will keep my
hands off unless your folly brings you
into collision with the laws of the United
States, when my hand will go on in a way
you will not like. So far as I am concern
ed you have barked up the wrong tree.
I am not to be either wheedled or frightened
into meddling with what is none
my business." of
