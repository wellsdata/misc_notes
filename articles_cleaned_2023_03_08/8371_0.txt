TENNESSEE LYNOHINGS.
More Indictments Found for the Mil
lington Murderers.
Memphis, Tenn., Sept. 9.- The grand
jury, which had been in session all day
yesterday, at 10:30 o'clock last night re
turned six true bills against M. Strick
faden, Jim Perley and Ed Smith for
murder. They are charged with being
parties to the lynching of the six negroes
at Millington on the night of Aug. 81.
These three had
already been ar
rested on bench and
warrants
their indictment created considerable
excitement. Following the action of the
grand jury, Judge J. G. Cooper issued a
bench warrant for Assistant Jailer Will
cox on a charge of perjury. Cox, who
was in the ante- room waiting to appear
before the grand jury, was arrested and
jailed. It is reported that the mob which
shot the negroes did not consist of over
ten people. Ten men would not have made
the attack, unless they had had an understanding
with Richardson. The whole
plot will be laid bare, at least, that is
what the officers say.
TO THANK THE WHITES.
A call was issued to- day by all the pastors
of the colored churches in
the city
for a mass meeting of
to- morrow night for the
purpose
purpose of publicly thanking Gov.
Turney, Judge Cooper and the white citizens
of Memphis for the determination
they have shown to bring the Millington
lynchers to justice. Funds will also be
raised for the widows and orphans of the
six negroes who were murdered by the
mob.
THE PLOT LAID BARE.
The whole plot of the Kerrville lynch
is now laid bare. Before many hours
elapse, it is thought every one who had
anything to do with the affair, or the majority
of them, will be behind the bars.
Bob McCarver, son of Sheriff Mc
Carver, is the one who gave the necessary
information. He was invited to participate
in the killing by Smith one of the
men now in the county jail under indict
ment for murder in the first degree. It
was represented to McCarver that his
father, the sheriff, knew all about it, and
that Judge Cooper, of the criminal court,
was not in the dark. The false representations
were made by Smith for the pur
pose of mixing Sheriff McCarver up in the
affair through his son, so his hands would
be tied if an investigation should be instituted
by the authorities.
The scheme failed. McCarver's examination
resulted in the arrest of Jailer
Cox for perjury and the binding of Mc
Carver in$ 10,000 bonds to insure his remaining
in the city.
LYNCHING IN LOUISIANA.
A Desperado Riddled and a Bloody
Feud Thought Possible.
Minden, La., Sept. 9.- Link Waggoner,
a noted desperado of North Louisiana
and Eastern Texas, was shot to death in
his cell in the parish jail by a mob last
night at 1 o'clock. Waggoner, for the
past five years, had been a terror
in that country. Innumerable mur
ders are laid at his door, and
his robberies most daring
were.
He was captured about two months ago
at Nacogdoches, Tex, and brought to
Homer in Clayborne county and tried on
a charge of murder. The case was not
proven against him and he was sent to
the jail here for safe keeping to
await trial on other charges
against him. While at Homer an attempt
was made by a mob to kill him,
but single- handed- having in some unaccountable
manner obtained possession of a
pistol- he kept the whole mob at bay until
assistance arrived. Last night the jail
here was broken into by a mob of
seventy- five, who shot him dead in his
cell and then dispersed Waggoner has
.
three brothers in Nacogdoches, and it is
believed they will make an attempt to
avenge his death. The desperado had a
good many friends in this section of the
country and they may also join in the
feud, which would a bloody one from
the outset. be
