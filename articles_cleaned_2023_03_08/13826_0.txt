LYNCH ILLINOIS MOB WANTED TO.
But Jailer Protected Negro Accused of Attempted
Assault on Woman.
Shawneetown, Ill., Sept. 1.- A mob of fifty masked
men went to the jail here early this morning and
demanded that the jailer, named Galloway, turn
over to them John H. Griffin, colored, who was un
der arrest for an attempted assault on Mrs. Joseph
Hobbs, a white woman, near her own home. Griffin
was frightened away by the woman's screams,
and was arrested a short while afterward,
When the mob demanded the negro, Galloway
armed himself, and after reasoning with the men
from the jail door, warned them that any effort to
force the jail would be at their own peril. The
mob, in spite of the jailer's words. made several
ineffectual attempts to break down the doors,
finally dispersing about day light.
Many of the colored people are taking sides
with Griffin, though some of them have, in fear of
a race riot, left the town. No trouble has followed
the visit of the mob to the jail this morning, but
preparations are making to take the negro
Carmi for safe keeping. to
