Murderers Sentenced.
CHARLESTON, W. Va., July 15.
At ten o'clock last night Judge
Guthrie held a special session of court
and sentenced Charles Spurlock, a
member of the Hill boys( Jesse James
gang,) who murdered Alvin Woods
and shot his father, Jack Woods,
near St. Alban's, in this county, in
the latter part of April. Spurlock is
to hang October 17th. His only re
quest when sentence was pronounced
was to be baptised. Notwithstanding
his
degree, when he was brought out for
trial he said last night that he did so
in fear of a mob, and denies ever
ing killed any one. hav-
