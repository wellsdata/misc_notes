Negro Lynched in Louisiana.
NEW ORLEANS, La., Jan. 25.- A negro
named Williams was lynched in Webster
Parish, La., yesterday morning. The man
called at the house of a white farmer
near Doyline, and, it is said, attempted a
criminal assault. A posse subsequently
captured him and he was taken to the
jail at Doyline. Several citizens stood
guard over the jail all night to prevent a
lynching. Yesterday an effort was made
to get the negro to the Parish jail at
Minden, but while on the way there the
prisoner was away from the officers
by a mob and taken shot to death.
