NEGRO LYNCHED.
Southern Method of Disposing of
a Murderer.
LOUISVILLE, Ky., Aug. 28.- Between
1 and 2 o'clock this morning about
thirty horsemen rode into Newcastle,
the county seat of Henry county, and,
waking up the jailer, told him they had
a prisoner. They were after a negro
named Leonard Taylor. Securing their
man they took him about a quarter of
a mile ont on the road to Franklin
ton and strung him up to an oak tree.
The lynching was conducted with as
much order as possible. Those who
took part in it were evidently reputable
citizens of the county, and so sure were
they that they were acting for the good
of the community that they took no
precautions to conceal their identity.
being apparently satisfied that lit
tle effort would be made to uncover
them. The crime which aroused the
party into acting was the brutal and
unprovoked assault upon an Italian boy
peddler. It occurred a week ago at
Franklinton, a little place seven or
eight miles from Newcastle. The
negro struck the boy over the head,
fracturing his skull. He was brought
to this city, which was his home, and
the Franklinton people learned
day that he had died. yester
