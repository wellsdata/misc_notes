is
Lynch Law- High- handed Measure.
est
FREDERICKSBURG, Va., July 23.- A
terrible outrage took place in Culpepper,
in this State, on Wednesday last. A mob
of two hundred men, including justices
ust
of the peace, members of churches, and
others, proceeded to the jail, resisted the
sheriff, and carried off William Grayson,
a free negro. They dragged him to the
woods, where they hung him dead. The
cause of this high- handed measure is this
-Grayson has twice been convicted of
murdering David W. Miller, a white man
but each time he appealed, and the Gen-
eral Court granted new trials, on the en
ground that the testimony hardly justified
suspicion- much less guilt. The mob for
allowed Grayson one minute to confess. tate
He firmly avowed his innocence of the
murder. The mob then placed a fence
rail across between two trees, and strung
him up. This outrage has created in 30
tense excitement. The papers entreat
the Governor to arrest every man
cerned in it. con
