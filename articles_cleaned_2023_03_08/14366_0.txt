Killed the Wrong Man.
ADA, O., Aug. 24.- At the Harding
county fair last week John Bristol, of
Fort Wayne, and John Fruth, of Fos
toria, became involved in a quarrel with
Charles Matthews, but he got away
from them before they came to blows.
Bristol and Fruth came out of a saloon
and observed Jacob Stokesbr.ry on the
sidewalk nearby, talking with two
be
friends. Fruth and Bristol mistook
Stokesbury for Matthews and both at
tacked and knocked him down, and
beat him so badly that he died shortly
afterward. Fruth was arrested after
some resistance and hurried to Kenton,
the county seat, to save him from lynch
ing. Bristol is in jail at Ada, and if he
is not soon removed he will probably be
lynched. Stokesbury was a thrifty
young farmer and had never seen his
sailants before. as
