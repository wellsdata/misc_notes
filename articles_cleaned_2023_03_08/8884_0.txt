Law. Lynch
Wadesboto Messenger Intelligencer.
There has been much discussion of
lynch law by our State exchanges
since the recent lynchings of Luke,
Hough in this country. In the main
the papers have endorsed the summary
execution of the brute by the
citizens of the McFarland neighborhood
, and are almost unanimously
opposed to any effort being made to
The neces
punish them for the act.
sity of resorting to lynch law is great
ly deplored, but as long as the dia-
bolical crime which provokes it is
committed, it is the ananimous
opinion of all the papers that have
discussed the matter that there is lit
the hope of putting an end to this
form of violence.
It is a very serious matter to put a
man to death, brute though he may
be, otherwise than by legal process.
So far as the rights of the person who is
has committed the nameless crime
are concerned, it matters not how
quick he is put out of the way, or as
to the manner of his taking off. It is
the effect that mob violence has on
soeiety in general that concerns every
good citizen. There can be no doubt
that lynchings have a demoralizing
effect, though we do not believe, as
do some, that they have a tendency
to increase the very crime which
usually causes them.
But what is the use of further discussing
the matter? Everybody
agrees that lynchings are bad, but
that does not alter the determination,
of at least 90 per cent. of the white
manhood of the South, to hang the
brute who assaults a woman as soon
as he is caught and his guilt proved.
The negroes themselves are responsible
for lynch law. Let them cease
our women and the crime
assaulting will never again be heard of.
