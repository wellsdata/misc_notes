A Fiendish Ravisher Lynched.
SAVANNAH, Ga., July 17.- Information
was received here to- day that Jake
well( colored) was lynched at noon yester Bras
day near Flatford, Bullock county. Bras
well had ravished and horribly maltreated
Dolly Woods, a little six- year- old girl,
while on her way to school. She identified
him after his capture, and he confessed to
saying that he would have killed the child,
but thought her dead when he left her. A
crowd of 100 whites and blacks held a conference
, and gave Braswell the choice of
being burned or hanging himself. He
chose hanging, and climbed up a tree and
fastened a rope around his own neck and
the limb of a tree, but then refused to
jump off. A negro climbed up, tied Bras
well's hands and the crowd pushed him off
a pole. His body was riddled with
with bullets. The child is not expected to live.
