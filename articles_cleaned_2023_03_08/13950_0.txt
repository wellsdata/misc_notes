BEECHER."
" COLORED HENRY WARD
Addresses Americanization Confer
" The Cure of Race
on
ence Troubles and Riots."
ILLIAM Pickens, associate field
secretary the National Association
for of the Advancement of
Colored People, known for his oratory
as the" Colored Henry Ward Beecher,"
was to address the Christian Ameri
canization Conference in Philadelphia
February 12). Mr. Pickens,
today(
who won the Ten Eyck Oratorical
prize for oratory from a class of 300
men at Yale University, recently re
signed as dean and vice president of
Morgan College in order to join the
Advancement Association's staff.
" The chief cause of race riots in the
United States," said Mr. Pickens," is
the attitude of mind in the white public
toward the Negro race.
" As long as an intelligent and religious
white man discriminates
against the Negro race, regardless of
individual merit, the ignorant and ir
religious white man will do the same
-but that ignorant and irreligous
white man will be coarser and more
brutal in his dealings with the Negro.
" The politician in Washington at
temps to lynch the Negro civilly and
politicially; the man at home in Tex
as attempts to lynch him with a rope.
The one lynches him in soul, the other
in body. If where the Negro is concerned
, the senator respects no law,
human or divine as one of them said,
then the lynching of the Negro is the
most logical thing in the country.
" The better classes of both races
must deliberately and consciously
seek out co- operation and acquaintanceship
with each other's aspira
Interracial
worth. com
tions, needs,
mittees should exist wherever there is
an appreciable number of colored peo
ple, to promote interracial amity. And
any organized effort to affect the race
problem in any particular, must be
along the lines of the National Asso
Advancement of Col
ciation for the
ored People that is it must consist of
both white and colored men, deliber
pursuing this solution. Neither
ately
race can settle the matter alone. The
man has already failed in that
method white the Negro need not try it.
