assault Mrs. Ben Rice, near here Fri
day, and who was driven off by Mrs.
Rice's shepherd dog, was summarily
executed Sunday by his intended victim's
husband and about 300 sympathizers
Tied to a tree with his arms
up, the. negro was riddled with bullets,
the first shot being fired by Rice, fol
which every man in the crowd
lowing emptied his revolver at the prisoner.
Over 1.000 shots were fired. The
negro was captured half a mile below
town and was taken before Mrs. Rice,
who fainted at sight of him. Upon re
covering she fully identified her assailant
, and on being asked what should
be done with, told the negro's captors
to do as him they thought best.
Harding was taken a short distance
from the Rice home, where a conference
of the mob leaders was held. Some
said burn him, but shooting was decided
on. Beyond confessing his guilt,
negro had nothing to say and was
the stolidly indifferent to his fate.
