LYNCH LAW IN MISSOURI- We learn from
the Columbia, Mo., Statesman, the following
particulars of the execution of a negro by the
mob:
" Hiram, a negro man belonging to Col.
Young. of Boon county, attempted to commit
a rape on the daughter of a respectable citizen.
He was taken before a Justice, and the trial
was progressing, when a mob of citizens rush
ed into the court room, put a rope around the
negro's neck, and forced him into a wood
north of the Court House, where an attempt
was made to hang him, but the rope broke,
and the mob was prevailed on to take him back
to jail.- These occurrences took place on Saturday
, the 20th of August. On Sunday, the
negro confessed his guilt, implicating two oth
er negroes in the crime. On Monday, a meet.
ing of citizens was called, and the question of
burning the negro was voted down. The question
to hang him was then put, and carried al
most unanimously. A committee of ten was
then appointed, who procured a rope, cart and
coffin, went to the jail, broke open the door,
and took the negro out to the edge of the town
and quietly hung and buried him.",
