with the murder of Mrs. Bjorngvin
Johnson near Walhalla Wednesday,
will have a chance to plead to the
charge before the next term of district

Officers claim he said he would
plead guilty if brought into court at
once and he will appear before Dis-
trict Judge W. J. Kneeshaw, who was
to come here Saturday afternoon
from Pembina.
According to Sheriff H. C. Well, LeMay
had little to say about the mur
der and when questioned told substantially
the same story as related
by members of the Johnson family.
LeMay was captured near his home
Thursday night and waived preliminary
examination when arraigned

Funeral services for Mrs. Johnson
will be held Sunday at the Lutheran
church near Hallson, with burial in
the Hallson cemetery ...
Sheriff Well investigated a report
that efforts had been made in the
neighborhood where the murder occurred
to form a" mob" to lynch the
prisoner but on his return here said
he found, no indication of such action.
