OPERATORS TALK TERMS
President Ratchford Hears Good News
From Pittsburg- Miners all Over
the Country are Preparing for
Grand Mass Meetings August 5
COLUMBUS, July 30. President
Ratchford dictated the following statement
this morning concerning the
Pittsburg uniformity plank:" Have
not studied the new uniformity contract
closely the Pittsburg operators are re-
ported to have agreed on, but believe i
is in stance the same contract which
failed in March, 1896, after a month's
effort and agitation to secure the required
number of operators to put it
into operation. Had such a plan been
agreed to at that time the presenting
crisis would have been averted. As to
its effect upon the present trouble there
is no hope it will do anything to bring
about a settlement."
President Ratchford received the
following telegram from Pittsburg this
morning:" Two of De Armitt's mines
stopped today. When we get other one,
W will have to take unit rmity."
( Signed) P .. DOLAN, president.

Lynchers Foiled at San Antonio.
SAN ANTONIO, Tex., July 30.- The
lynching of Henry Robinson, a negro
Puliman porter who assulted Emma
Wulff Tuesday, was on
ly prevented late last
night
by the brave and cool stand made by
officers guarding the jailin which the
prisoner is confined. The mob met at
convention hall at 11:30 p. m., and
marched to jail about 600 strong at
midnight. The leader demanded the
door to be opened. This was done and
a big officer grabbed the leader and
hustled him into a cell and closed the
door before the crowd could force ac
mittance. Several speeches made in
an effort to incite the mob and these
speakers were arrested on the charge
of inciting the mob to violence. The
mob were dispersed by a big squad of
police and no further attempt was
made. It is believed another effort
made tonight
will be to lynch the
pris
oner.
