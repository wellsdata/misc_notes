NEGRO UPRISING
IS A POSSIBILITY
Norfolk, Va., Officers Ask for Militia
Protection After a Lynch
ing.
Norfolk, Va., Oct. 25.- As a result
of the lynching of the negro Blount at
Berkley, a suburb of the city, a negro
uprising is feared and the mayor of
Berkley has requested Gov. Montague
to hold a sufficient force in readiness
to meet it if necessary.
The governor is in touch with Col.
Higgins, of the 71st regiment, who
says he can throw enough men into
Berkley within an hour to cope with
any situation that might develop.
George W. Blount was a negro politician
and the proprietor of a fish and
oyster shop in the sububrbs of Berk
ley. He was taken early yesterday
morning from the police station, where
he was confined, by a mob of 50 mask-
ed men and lynched. Blount had been
arrested Saturday night for striking T.
D. Holloman, a Berkley policeman in
the face with a lighted lamp.,
