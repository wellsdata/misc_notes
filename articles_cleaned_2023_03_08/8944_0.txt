VAN B. TRIPLET DEAD.
Originator of the Gold Brick Swin-
dle Expires in Poverty.
CHICAGO, May 2.- Van B. Triplet, the
originator of the gold brick swindle, who
is said to have swindled people out of a
million dollars by different kinds of confidence
games, died yesterday at West Bad
en in poverty. Money is now being raised
by friends to give him a decent burial.
Triplet, who was also known as John V.
Tripp, and" Old Tripp," was born in Virginia
sixty years ago and came of a good
family. He began his life of crime when
he was young and for more than forty
years had been pitted against the police.
Although the origin of the gold brick
game is sometimes credited to Bill Train,
who is said to be responsible for the
death of" Red" Leahy in New York, it
was Triplet who first made the game a
financial
success. The police say he sold
hundreds of gold bricks and made a for
tune out of them.
He served time for an action of this
kind but once, and that was when he and
" Big Ed" Minor sold a brick to Chinamen
in Dayton, Ohio. Both he and Minor were
sent to the penitentiary for the crime and
Triplet was released in 1891. After that
he went to the Klondike and made a companion
of" Soapy" Smith," Kid" Bowen,
and" Kid" Eddie Fresh. They were accused
of buncoing a miner out of a sack
of gold dust. In the events that followed
Smith was killed, after he had shot Frank
Reid, the district attorney at Skagway.
Triplet was sentenced to a year's imprisonment
at Sitka. While he was in
jail a mob gathered about the jail to
lynch him. Officers dispersed the
mob,
however, and Triplet served out his term.
He was often subjected to arrest in Chica
go, and Detective Murnane is said to have
taken him to the central station more
than 100 times. At last John D. Shea, then
chief of detectives, gave orders that he
was not to be molested unless there
proof that he had committed some crime was.
