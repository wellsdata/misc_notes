IT WAS MURDER.
The Public Indignant Over the Cruel
Lynching of Hans Olsen.
As the details of the recent lynching
of Hans Jacob Olsen in the town of Pres
ton are disclosed they become revolting,
all the more so, too, from the fact that
there was no other cause for his
lynching than that he had ill- treated
his family and was considered a general
nuisance in the neighborhood. The
people of Grant County have become
thoroughly aroused over the mur
der, which is undoubtedly one of the
most cruel, cold- blooded and inexcusable
ever committed in Wisconsin, and
the public sentiment demands that
all who were implicated should be prosecuted
. Young Bersing, who gave
himself up, has furnished the county
authorities with the names of all pres
ent and what was said and done. His
most startling disclosure is that Olsen's
own son, a young man of 17 years, assisted
the vigilantes, even pulling on
the which sent his father
rope
into eternity. After the rope
around Olsen's
was first placed
neck he told that
his life
was
would be spared if he would leave the
county. Probably thinking that his
captors were only trying to frighten
him, Olsen was obstinate and his only
reply was a volley of oaths. A prominent
farmer is said to have been the
and leader of the mob, which
organizer numbered about 100 in all.
