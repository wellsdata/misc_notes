REMOVED FOR SAFE KEEPING
Negro Assaulters Taken to State
Prison to Prevent Lynching.
Sheriff Learned of an Organized Plan
to Lynch Negroes and
Spirited Them Away Hastily.
-
Council Bluffs, Ia., Dec. 30.- Neely
Zimmerman and George Burk, the negroes
who Monday night narrowly es
caped lynching at the hands of an infuriated
mob, were Tuesday night
taken to the state penitentiary at Fort
Madison, Ia., for safe keeping. During
the afternoon the men were taken be
fore Judge Wheeler and waived preliminary
examination. The judge then
signed an order for their removal, and
the
men were hastily
spirited away,
and Sheriff Cousins left with them on
the first train for Fort Madison.
During the day Sheriff Cousins
learned of an organized plan to lynch
Zimmerman and Burk Tuesday night,
and again made a request for a com
pany of militia to guard the county
jail, and arranged for a heavy force of
city police to assist in case their serv
ices were required. The feeling against
the prisoners increased, and during the
afternoon a small group of men gath
ered in the vicinity of the jail to dis
cuss the matter. Sheriff Cousins then
decided that the safer course was to
remove the men from the city, and
applied for an order of removal.
Four assaults within a week, similar
to those made on Mrs. Sparks and her
daughter, had wrought up the working
people of the city to a pitch of fever
ish excitement, and this feeling was
freely voiced on every street corner.
Monday night's experience and Tues
day's developments were sufficient to
lead the authorities to the belief that
a bold attempt would be made Tuesday
by a well- organized mob to lynch the
negroes, and they then decided to avoid
all trouble by removing the cause
a repetition of the disturbance. for
