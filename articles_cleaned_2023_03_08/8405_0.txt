KENTUCKY
The reports of outrages, hangings, mob
law and violence of every kind, that come
us from Kentucky, are the fit accompaniment
of the news that the Democracy have
elected every Congressman in the State. It
is true that one of the Congressmen elect
bas since committed suicide by blowing out
his brains, leaving an explanatory note, in
which he expresses the opinion that with
his views( that is, Copperhead views), be
could do the country no good, which is
equivalent to a dying declaration against the
principles and policy of the whole Copper
head party. But this vacancy will be filled,
doubtless, by a man who has not the con
sclence to blow his brains out because he
sees that his political associations will per
mit him to do nothing but harm to the
country.
Who could expect anything but a Copper
bead victory in a State where one day we
are informed that a whole county is In
urmed insurrection against the officers of the
law, and the next that a mob has broken
into a jail, and, dragging forth a prisoner,
convenient tree- where offl
bung him to a
cers are shot by stealth in the discharge of
their duty? where detachments of United
States soldiers are attacked and driven off?
and where, in short, a lawless and blood
thirsty gang of robbers and desperadoes,
under the name of Regulators, have usurped
the powers of the Courts, and rule triumph
ant, apparently by the consent and with the
approbation of the people? Such is now
the state of affairs in Kentucky, and to expect
anything but Copperhead victories from
such quarter would be like expecting
cheap a board in Washington.
