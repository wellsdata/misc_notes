ENOUGH OF LAWLESSNESS.
Two wrongs do not make one right
nor does the violation of the law committed
in the murder of Conductor
Flury justify another violation of the
law in mob vengeance on his assailants.
It is to be hoped that despite all
provocation, the talk of lynching and
mob violence, which has been prevalent
in this community for several days and
culminated with the news of Flury's
death, will be forthwith abandoned for
the determination that the law shall
have its regular course in dealing with
the criminals.
The immediate restoration of orderly
conditions is absolutely imperative for
the good name and reputation of our
city. Omaha has been sufficiently advertised
abroad of late by the two Pat
Crowe acquittals and by the subsequent
outbreak of holdups to make further
publicity along this line desirable. What
Omaha needs now is to counteract the
impression outside that it is peopled
with men and women inspired with race
prejudice and envy of the rich, which
would deny the equal protection of the
laws.
The motto of Nebraska is," Equality
before the w." and
is a good
to stick to. motto
