Routed by the Strikers.
As a result of the battle the men in the
Strip were routed by the strikers and were
forced to flee for their lives, pursued by a
howling mob, which would have lynched
them had they been caught. The owner of
the Clements, his son and a man named Big
Dick Reed are said to be the ones who did
the shooting, and they have given them
selves up, and were run out of the
for safe keeping. county
