FIVE NEGROES LYNCHED
For Killing and Burning a Popular
White Man.
MONTGOMERY, Ala., 21.- A gentle
man who arrived at 9 o'clock tonight
from Greenville, Ala., forty miles
south of here, reports that five
negroes were lynched near there last
night. Just before his train left
Greenville tonight, the sheriff of the
county came into town and reported
that in passing Buckalow plantation,
three miles from town, he had found
the five negroes, three men and two
women, hanging by their necks to
some trees, their bodies cold, and they
evidently had been dead some hours.
Last night news reached Greenville of
the brutal murder, near Butler, in
that county, of Watts Murphy, a popular
young white man, by the negroes.
Murphy was a prominent young far
mer, being a nephew of the late Gov.
Watts, of this city. After murdering
him the negroes placed his body on a
brush heap and burned the heap. The
debris was examined, and the heart
and liver of the victim were found,
the balance of the bady having been
consumed. An investigation
was instituted
. Three negroes were finally
arrested. Today one of the negroes
gave way, and confessed the crime,
implicating two other
negro men
and two women. The officers secured
them and were closely guarding them
when last heard of last night. The
report tonight does not give the de
tails of how the mob secured the murderers
, except that they were taken
by force. A telegram
from
confirms the story. Greenville
