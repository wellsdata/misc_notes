Lynch Law.
One of the most determined mobs
that ever gathered in western Kansas
lynched William McKinley aud bis
son, Lewis, at Sharon Springs last
Monday night, for the of
Charles Garley.
The crime which led up to the
hanging was cruel and revolting.
About a week ago Charles Garley, a
son- in- law of William McKinley, was
murdered. Au investigation revealed
that Fred, 17- year- old son of McKinley
, senior, committed the crime. The
boy when' arrested made a confession
stating that he had been induced to
kill bis brother- in- law by his father
and his older brother, Lewis. The
motive of the murder seemed princ.-
pally revenge and hatred. The murdered
man had only a few weeks before
married McKinley's daughter.
a It had been stipulated before the marriage
that the groom was to pay the
bride's father$ 200 for the privilege
of marrying her. The groom refused
to pay the money after he was mar
and thus incurred the enmity of
ried his wife's fathers and brothers.
