The" Duluth Herald" does delight
in" rapping" the Klan every once or
twice in the while. The foregoing is
the latest splatter from its editorial
desk We call your attention to the
third. paragraph.
The contention herein is made that
Governor Walton stands for law and
order. The most biased news dis-
patches point directly to the true situation
, and we know that the editor
of the" Duluth Herald" knows this, so
plainly an insiduous effort is being
made to discredit the Klan without
any regard for the facts, whatsoever.
The editor in the Zenith City evidently
enjoys snorting around like a bull in
monkey- cage and therefore" cracks"
at the K. K. K. should not be considered
by us- let the fellow have his
pleasure at the usual spasmodic intervals
we should worry.
However ponder over the statement
" Even if he sometimes fights in the
wrong way, he fights for what is
right." Let us venture the query,
Can you do right by doing wrong?
" Never," we make answer. What a
strange mind that sees righteousness
in wrong. The editor of the" Duluth
Herald" takes the position of the man
who justifies the lynching of a negro
rapist by insisting that the wrong
way corrects evil conditions. Isn't it
absurd to make any such contention.
You cannot correct a wrong by committing
another The editor
wrong.
of" Duluth Herald" says distinctly
that we are wrong but he being the
Oracle of the Pine Stump, his philo-
soophy of jungle must carry
weight. Dear Editor, read the
chapter of Romans, yes, it's in
the 12th Bible, and learn how wild you are.
