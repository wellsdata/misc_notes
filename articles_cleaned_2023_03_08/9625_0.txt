BACK TO BARBARISM.!
A party of men headed by the clerk of the superior court at Dawson, Ga.
carried a young white girl to the woods in an automobile, stripped her and
flayed her with a whip until she now lies at the point of death, for no other
reason than that she would not take an oath that she would never again
see the 20- year- old son of one of the scoundrels.
It seems incredible in this age that such infernal atrocities can be committed
and the perpetrators go unpunished. We are accustomed to look
back to the eras gone by for inhumanity and brutality, and we are wont to
hold up our hands in horror as we read of the tyranny of sovereigns in their
torture of their subjects. Then now and again there comes to light some
such infernal act as that above related and we realize that what we call
our civilization is but a poor veneer and that the brute instinct is a strong
element in the human construction. We cannot help feeling that justice
has been done when some human brute has been taken out and lynched for
outraging womanhood and no sympathy is felt for him. There is not a man
living, who has any decency or chivalry or red blood in him, who would
not defend and fight for a good woman, and when a body of hellish fiends
masking as men, attack a woman as was done in Georgia, for a reason so
petty, one feels that no punishment too severe can be meted out to the offenders
. One wonders if the time will ever come when the strain in humanity,
which is worse than that in the brute, will ever fade out. It is not revenge
that incites the brute to cruelty but either protection to itself or its kind,
hunger, but that spirit when controlling man is pure unadulterated fiend-
ishness or.
