GET THEIR
JUST DUES.
Famous Dalton Gang Wiped
From the Face of the
Earth.
But Lives of Peaceful Citizens
Are Sacrificed in Accomplishing
It.
The Desperados Boldly Attempt
to Rob Two Banks in
Kansas.
Caught in the Act by Townspeople
and a Most Bloody Battle
Ensues.
Coffeeville, Kan., Oct. 5.- The Dalton
gang has been exterminated- wiped
off the face of the earth. Caught like
rats in a trap, they were today shot
down, but not until four citizens of
this place lost their lives in the work
of extermination.
Six of the gang rode into town this
morning and robbed two banks of
this place. Their raid had become
known to the cfficers of the law, and
when the bandits attempted to escape
they were attacked by the marshal's
posse. In the battle which en-
sued four desperados were killed out
right and one so badly wounded that
he has since died. Others escaped,
but are being hotly pursued. Of the
attacking party four were killed, one
fatally and two seriously wounded.
The dead are: Bob Dalton, desperado
; Gratton Dalton, desperado; Emmitt
Dalton, desperado; Joseph Evans, desperado
; John Moore," Texas Jack,"
desperado; T. C. Connelly, city mar
shal; L. M. Baldwin, bank clerk; G.
W. Cubine, merchant; C. J. Brown,
shoemaker.
The wounded are: Thos. Gayer,
cashier of the First National bank,
shot through the groin and cannot
live; T. A. Reynolds wounded in the
,
right breast; Lais Ditz, shot in the
right side.
It was rumored a month ago that the
Dalton gang were contemplating an
immediate raid upon the barks of the
city. Arrangements were made to
give them a warm reception, but the
excitement finally died away and the
street patrol was given up.
About 10 o'clock this morning the
gang rode into town. They came in
two squads of three each and passing
through unfrequented streets and rendezvoused
in an ally in the rear of the
First National bank. Robert Dalton,
the notorious leader, and Emmtit, his
brother, went to the First National,
the other four under the leadership of
Texas Jack, or John Moore, going to
the private bank of C. M. Congdon
Co.&
In the meantime an alarm was given.
The Dalton brothers, born and bred in
this vicinity, had been recognized.
City Marshal Connelly was quickly
notified and collected a posse. While
the marshal his
was calling forces the
bandits, all ignorant of the trap, were
proceeding deliberately with the work
of banks.
The Texas Jack band entered Cong-
don's bank and with Winchesters
leveled at Cashier Ball and Teller Carpenter
, demanded the safe to be open
ed. The cashier explained that the safe
door was controlled by a time lock
and could not be opened for about
twenty minutes- at 10 o'clock," We'll
wait," said the leader, and he sat down
at the cashier's desk first gathering
, up
the money in the cash drawers.
Bob and Emitt Dalton meanwhile
were having better luck at the
First National bank. When they en-
tered the bank they found Cashier
Ayers, his son Albert, and Teller W.
H. Shepherd. None of them were
armed and with levelled revolvers the
bandits easily intimidated them. Al-
bert Ayers and Teller Shepherd were
kept under the muzzles of Emmitt
Dalton's revolvers while Bob Dalton
forced Cashier Ayers to strip the safe
of its valuables, and also rid the
drawers of all their money and he then
Fearing to leave them behind lest
they should give the alarm too soon,
the desperado marched the officers of
the bank out of the door with the intention
of keeping them under guard
while they made their escape.
The party made their appearance at
the door just as Liveryman Spears and
others of the marshal's posse took positions
in the square.
When the Dalton brothers saw the
armed men in the square they appreciated
their peril instantly and leaving
the bank officers on the steps of the
bank building ran for their horses.
As soon as they reached the sidewalk
Spears rifle quickly came into position.
An instant later it sped, and Bob Dal
ton, the notorious leader of a notorious
fell dead Emmitt Dalton had
gang.
,
the start of his brother and before
Spears could draw dead on him had
dodged behind the corner of the bank
and was making time in the direction
of the alley where the horses were tied.
The hot that dropped Bob Dalton
aroused Texas Jack's band in Cong
don's bank. Running to the windows
saw their leader prostrate on the
they ground. Raising their rifles they fired
one volley out of the windows. Cashier
Ayers fell on the steps of the bank, shot
through the groin. Shoemaker Brown
of the attacking party in the square was
shot through the body and died in a few
minutes.
The bring attracted the attention of
Marshali Connelly, who was collect
ing more men for his posse, and with
a few he had already gathered, he ran
hurriedly to the scene of conflict.
After firing a volley from the windows
the bandits, appreciating that
their only safety lay in flight, attempted
to escape. They ran from the door
of the bank, firing as they fied. The
marshal's posse in the square, with
out organization of any kind, fired at
the fleeing bandits, each for himself.
Spears' trusty Winchester shot twice
more in quick succession before the
others could take aim. and Joseph
Evans and Texas Jack fell dead, both
shot through the head, making three
dead bandits to his credit.
In the general fusillade, Gratton Dal
ton, one or two of the surviving mem
bers of Texas Jack's band, Marshal
Connelly, L. M. Baldwin, one of Cong
don's clerks, and Geo. Cubine, were
mortally hit and died on the field. Allie
Ogee, the only survivor of the band,
successfully escaped to the alley where
the horses were tied and mounting the
swiftest of the lot, filed south in the
direction of Indian territory. Emitt
Dalton, who escaped from the First National
bank, reached the alley in safety
but had some trouble in getting mount
ed.
Several of the posse quickly mounted
and pursued the escaping bandits. Em-
mitt Dalton's horse was no match for
the fresher animals of his pursuers. As
they closed on him he turned suddenly
in his saddle and fired upon his wouldbe
captors. The latter answered with
a volley and Emmitt toppled from his
horse hard hit. He was brought back
to town and died late this afternoon.
He made an ante- mortem statement
confessing to the various crimes committed
by the gang. Allie Ogee is still
at large.
After the battle was over a search
was made for the money the bandits
secured from the banks. It was found
in sacks where it had been placed by
the robbers. One sack was found under
the body of Bob Dalton, who had fallen
dead upon it while he was escaping
from the First National bank. The
other was tightly clinched in Texas
Jack's hand.
The bodies of those of the attack
ing party who were killed were removed
to their respective homes, while the
bodies of the dead bandits were al
lowed to remain where they had fallen
until the arrival of the coroner from
Independence, who ordered them re
moved to the court house. There he
held an inquest, he jury returning a
verdict in accordance with the facts.
During the time the bodies remained
in the square they were viewed by hundreds
of people of this and surrounding
towns who, having heard of the tragedy
came in swarms to inspect the scene.
The excitement was of the most in
tense character and the fate of Allie
Ogee, should he be captured, is deter
mined by universal consent. He will
be hanged by the people.
Other topics which attracted universal
attention were the fulfillment of the
prophecy that the Dalton's" would
die with their boots on." and a peculiar
fate decreed that they should die by
the hands of their old friends in the
vicinity of their birth place, and the
excellent markmanship of Liverynar
Spears, who, with three shots,
to death as many bandits. sent
Later.
Emmitt Dalton is not yet dead. He
is slowly dying in a room at a hotel
here and death is expected at any moment
.
Indignation against the robbers was
intense this
so afternoon that eitizens
wanted to lynch the dying bandit. To
prevent this the corouer gave out the
statement that he was already dead.
Ut to 11 o'clock tonight Allie Ogee
is not captured.
There were five boys and three girls.
of the boys two were engaged in farm-

three of the brothers met death today.
