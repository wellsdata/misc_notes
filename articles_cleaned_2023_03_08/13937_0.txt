POSSE CAPTURES NEGRO
AND PLACES HIM IN JAIL
Merchantville. N. J .. Sept. 30.
James Whiting, the negro who is alleged
to have assaulted a white woman
of this place and for whom a posse
had been scouring the countryside
since yesterday afternoon, was сар-
tured tonight along Rancocas Creek,
near Mount Holly. He was locked up
in the Mount Holly jail.
The negro was captured by Detective
Parker, who rushed him to jail in
an automobile. Other members of the
posse of more than 500 armed
men
were not informed that the fugitive
had been taken into custody until he
had been locked up. Although threats
against the negro were made by some
of the men, most of them left for their
home shortly after learning of the
capture, and officials declared they did
not expect any violence.
Parker said Whiting was so nearly
exhausted that he did not offer any
resistance to arrest. His clothes were
soaked as a result of spending last
night in a swamp and he could
ly walk. He was unarmed. scarce
