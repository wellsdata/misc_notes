" Our country is disgusted by the
number of lynchings that occur both
in the north and south, and excuses
are sought for the horid and fiendish
oruelties perpetrated by mobs in such
cases in some other cause than the
delays of justice. Instances are cited
of where the mob has executed men
whom they had every reason to be
Here were to be justly punished un
der the law, to show that an improvement
in the criminal procedure
would not prevent lynchings. But
every man of affairs who has studied
the subject at all knows that if men
who commit crime were promptly ar
rested and convicted there, would be
no mob for the purpose of lynching.
Nothing but a radical improvement
in every administration of criminal
law will prevent the growth in the
number of lynchings in the United
that bring the blush of shame
to States every lover of his country."
