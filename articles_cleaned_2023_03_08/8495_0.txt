The County Convention of delegates

city was held at Apollo Hall, on the 19th
inst., Samuel G. Courtney presiding.
About 400 delegates were present. W.
W. Curtis warned the meeting that Tammany
intended frauds at the elections,
and said that the only remedy was to
execute summary justice, by suspending
repeaters or fraudulent Inspectors from

the would protect citizens in so doing.
