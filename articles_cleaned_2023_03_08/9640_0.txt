PESACOLA, Fla., July 30.- Three
men dead and a score wounded, probably
fatally is the record of a success.
ful attempt last night by a mob to
storm the County jail and take out
the negro Leander Shaw who during
the day had assaulted Mrs. Lillian
Davis near here.
The sheriff with half a dozen dep.
uties stood on the windows upstairs
with drawn revolvers and diffes. The
Sheriff pleaded with the mob, at the
same time telling them he would de
fend the prisoner at the cost of every
life present.
His word had no effect and the
moment the first blow was struck on
the gate a volley of shots flashed from
theupper windows of the jail. This
was answered by the crowd, which
poured volley after volley into the jail
windows, wounding the deputies. The
mob was momentarily driven back
with many wounded and one dead as
a result of the deadly aim of the
Sheriff and his deputies.
At midnight the mob, which in the
meantime had been reinforced by
many residents of the surrounding
country, made another attack on the
jail.
The Sheriff and officers were over
powered by men who had crept over
the hear wall and covered them with
rifles and revolvers. Others broke
down the cell door and took Shaw out.
The negro was carried to the center
of the plaza and hanged to an electric
light pole, after which fully 500 shots
were fired into his dangling body
-0-0.
