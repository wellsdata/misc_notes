Only the Presence of Squads of Officers
Prevented Great Riot.
Two men shot and two others injured
is the result of trouble between whites and
the Clay
negroes at- street car sheds,
Twenty- ninth and P streets, early yester
day afternoon, and the double crimes of
lynching and a race riot were only avert
ed by the timely arrival and prompt ac
tion of squads of policemen from the
three districts of the city. Motorman T.
H. Baber was shot by a negro named
Edward Watkins: an unknown.
negro
man was shot; Sergeant Werner was injured
on the hand by a base- ball bat,
and one of the negro rioters had the
knuckles of his hand broken. That many
lives were not lost in the fight is a mira
cle, and can only be accounted for by
the bad aim of the negroes.
The scene of the shooting of Motorman
Baber was the office of the company,
at the corner of Twenty- ninth and P
streets, and the fight between the two
races occurred in the street outside.
The trouble began on the car making the
run in. Watkins and another
negro
boarded the car and commenced cursing
and swearing. The motorman told them
to stop or get off the car. Then an altercation
arose between the two, which
resulted in the negro's being put off. He
ran and caught up with the car, which
he again boarded, and was again put
off.
The negro then made his way to the
offices to make complaint. The car had
in the meantime arrived at the sheds, and
the motorman, with the conductor, had
gone into the to report the matter,
and there the office two met again.
